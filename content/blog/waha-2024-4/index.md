We are thrilled to introduce the latest addition to WAHA -
[the brand new **Dashboard**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/dashboard" >}}),
exclusively available in
[**WAHA Plus**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/waha-plus" >}}) version!

🌟 Dashboard allows you to do:

1. **Monitor Sessions**: The Dashboard displays the total number of sessions on the server along with their statuses. It conveniently highlights sessions that require actions, allowing you to address any issues promptly.
2. **Session Management**: Take full control of your sessions with the Dashboard. Start a new session, view session information, generate QR codes, adjust settings, and stop/start or log out from sessions with ease.
3. **Secure Server Connection**: Easily connect to a server using your API key, ensuring a secure and seamless interaction with WAHA.
4. **Version Comparison**: Keep track of the latest project version and compare it to your current version. The Dashboard makes it easy to see when updates are available, empowering you to stay up-to-date with the latest features and improvements.

🔍 Accessing the Dashboard is as simple as running (remember to update it before!) the project and opening http://localhost:3000/dashboard (or a similar URL with /dashboard appended)I.

🔑 **Default username and password**: `waha / waha`

If you’re using API Key, remember to set up the key in the dashboard:
