We are excited to announce the release of **WAHA 2024.5**! 
This version introduces the [Swagger White Label]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/swagger#white-label" >}})
feature and includes several stability improvements.

Check the [üÜï Changelog]({{< relref "/docs/overview/changelog#20245" >}}) for a full list of changes.

# üåü NEW - Swagger White Label

üëâ Swagger White Label is available in [**WAHA Plus**]({{< relref "waha-plus#plus" >}}) version only.

If you're running SaaS or want to show your brand in the Swagger documentation,
you can now customize the Swagger documentation with your own brand!

![Swagger White Label](swagger-white-label.png)

Use the following environment variables to customize the Swagger documentation:
- `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_TITLE` - the title of the Swagger documentation and some other places.
- `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_DESCRIPTION` - Markdown formatted description of your API.
- `WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_EXTERNAL_DOC_URL` - URL to the external documentation.

**Example** (consider using [docker-compose](https://github.com/devlikeapro/waha/blob/core/docker-compose.yaml#L15-L38) or other methods to store these settings):
```bash
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -e WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_TITLE="AwesomeCRM" -e 'WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_DESCRIPTION=<p>FantasticFindz - Discover unique treasures from around the world at unbelievable prices!<br/> <a href='https://google.com'>Read more about us!</a></p>' -e "WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_EXTERNAL_DOC_URL=https://google.com" devlikeapro/waha-plus
```
