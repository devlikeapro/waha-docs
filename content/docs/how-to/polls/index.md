[**üì∂ Polls**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/polls" >}})
in WhatsApp is a good alternative for buttons and other interactive messages.

You can ask a question and provide a few options for the user to choose from. 
The user can select only one option or multiple options, depending on the poll configuration.

## API
### Send poll

Use the endpoint to send a poll!

```http request
POST /api/sendPoll
```

```jsonc { title="Body" }
{
  "session": "default",
  "chatId": "123123123@c.us",
  "poll": {
    "name": "How are you?",
    "options": [
      "Awesome!",
      "Good!",
      "Not bad!"
    ],
    "multipleAnswers": false
  }
}
```

```jsonc { title="Response" }
{
  "id": "true_321321321@c.us_83ACBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
  "other-fields-here": "value"
}
```

{{< callout context="tip" icon="outline/hand-finger-right" >}}
Save the `id` field from the response in your database so that you can identify the poll for which you receive
a vote (see webhook events below).
{{< /callout >}}

### Send Poll Vote

Cast a vote for an existing poll by specifying the poll message ID and the options you choose.

```http request
POST /api/sendPollVote
```

```jsonc { title="Body" }
{
  "chatId": "11111111111@c.us",
  "pollMessageId": "false_11111111111@c.us_AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 
  "pollServerId": null,
  "votes": [
    "Awesome!"
  ],
  "session": "default"
}
```

Fields:
- `chatId` - The WhatsApp ID of the chat where the poll was sent (e.g., "11111111111@c.us").
- `pollMessageId` - The ID of the poll message. Format: `{fromMe}_{chatID}_{messageId}[_{participant}]` or just `{ID}` (`AA...AA`) for **GOWS**. 
    - Example: `false_11111111111@c.us_AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`.
- `pollServerId` - Only for Channels ‚Äî server message id (number, if known). Optional; if omitted, the API may look it up in the storage.
- `votes` - Poll options you are voting for. Array of strings, e.g., `["Awesome!"]`.
- `session` - WAHA session name (e.g., `default`).

## Events
Read more about
[**üîÑ Events**]({{< relref "/docs/how-to/events" >}}).

### poll.vote

With this event, you receive new votes for the poll sent.

#### Vote from a user in direct messages.

```jsonc { title="poll.vote" }
{
  "event": "poll.vote",
  "session": "default",
  "payload": {
    "vote": {
      "id": "false_1111111111@c.us_83ACBE602A05C79B234B54415E95EE8A",
      "to": "me",
      "from": "1111111@c.us",
      "fromMe": false,
      "selectedOptions": [
        "Awesome!"
      ],
      "timestamp": 1692861427
    },
    "poll": {
      "id": "true_1111111111@c.us_BAE5F2EF5C69001E",
      "to": "1111111111@c.us",
      "from": "me",
      "fromMe": true
    }
  },
  "engine": "NOWEB"
}
```

#### Do I receive votes only for my polls?

No, you receive all votes. Keep in mind that you'll get all votes with this event, even from other polls. To identify
that it's your poll, look at the `poll.fromMe` field.

#### How to handle multiple-answer votes

For `multipleAnswers: true`, you receive the `selectedOptions` with all the selected values at a certain moment. So if a
user has chosen 3 options from the poll, you will receive **3** `poll.vote` events:

1. `selectedOptions: ["First"]`
2. `selectedOptions: ["First", "Second"]`
3. `selectedOptions: ["First", "Second", "Third"]`

#### Timestamp

If a user clicks on the poll multiple times, you will receive multiple `poll.vote` events. This is true for
both `multipleAnswers: false` (when a user changes their mind about answers) and `multipleAnswers: true` (when a user
selects two or more options) events.

There is a little chance that you may receive votes in the wrong order (due to the nature of HTTP and Webhooks),
like `1-3-2` instead of `1-2-3`. To determine the right order, look at the `timestamp` field. The event with a
higher `timestamp` value is more recent.

üëâ It's important to save the `timestamp` for each vote in your database and compare them as numbers, without converting to
internal datetime. Right now, the `timestamp` shows the timestamp in seconds, but it may be changed to milliseconds in
the future.

#### Vote from a user in a group

```jsonc { title="poll.vote" }
{
  "event": "poll.vote",
  "session": "default",
  "payload": {
    "vote": {
      "id": "false_3333333333333@g.us_1C18A7EAADD2A8D0324755D241C4238A",
      "to": "3333333333333@g.us",
      "from": "1111111111@c.us",
      "fromMe": false,
      "selectedOptions": [
        "Awesome!"
      ],
      "timestamp": 1692861427
    },
    "poll": {
      "id": "true_3333333333333@g.us_BAE5304BA1ECF704",
      "to": "33333333333333@g.us",
      "from": "222222222@c.us",
      "fromMe": true
    }
  },
  "engine": "NOWEB"
}
```

### poll.vote.failed

There may be cases when WAHA fails to decrypt a vote from the user. In such cases, you will receive
a `poll.vote.failed` event on your webhook.

The payload for `poll.vote.failed` is the same as for `poll.vote`, but with an empty list in `selectedOptions`.

```jsonc { title="poll.vote.failed" }
{
  "event": "poll.vote.failed",
  "session": "default",
  "payload": {
    "vote": {
      "id": "false_11111111111@c.us_2E8C4CDA89EDE3BC0BC7F605364B8451",
      "to": "me",
      "from": "111111111@c.us",
      "fromMe": false,
      "selectedOptions": [],
      "timestamp": 1692956972
    },
    "poll": {
      "id": "true_1111111111@c.us_BAE595F4E0A2042C",
      "to": "111111111@c.us",
      "from": "me",
      "fromMe": true
    }
  },
  "engine": "NOWEB"
}
```

#### How should I handle poll.vote.failed events?

When you send a poll, save the poll configuration (question and options) in your database with the `id` field from the
response you received from `POST /api/sendPoll`.

Later, when you receive a `poll.vote.failed` event, find the `id` for the poll in the database and repeat the same
question to the user, apologizing for the inconvenience.
For example, you can say:

> Sorry, we don't understand your choice üòû
>
> Please click one more time on the message below üëá

After the user clicks on the poll again, you will receive a `poll.vote` event with their choice.

#### How to test poll.vote.failed events?

To receive `poll.vote.failed` events, follow these steps:

1. Start a session and authorize it with a QR code.
2. Send a poll to a chat.
3. Stop the session (logout is not required).
4. Start the session again.
5. Vote on the poll.
6. You will receive a `poll.vote.failed` event.

#### Why does the poll.vote.failed event occur and when will it be fixed?

The issue occurs because WAHA does not have a proper storage system, but polls require proper storage in order to
decrypt votes later.

There will be two fixes for this:

1. In the short term, a [local file storage](https://github.com/devlikeapro/waha/issues/188) will be used
   to save poll keys.
2. In the long term, work is being done
   on [remote storages](https://github.com/devlikeapro/waha/issues/41).

Even after these fixes are implemented, it's better to handle `poll.vote.failed` events anyway, so your application is
prepared for such cases!
