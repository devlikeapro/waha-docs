You probably already have run the docker run command during
[**⚡ Quick Start**]({{< relref "/docs/overview/quick-start" >}}) guide:
```bash
docker run ... devlikeapro/waha
```

{{< callout context="caution" icon="outline/alert-triangle" >}}
☝️ The above command is good **for development purposes**, but **not for production**.
{{< /callout >}}

To make it **production-ready**, you need to configure a few more parameters to make it secure, reliable, and easy to manage. 💪🏻


## Why Self-Host WAHA?

Self-hosting WAHA gives you complete control over your privacy:

- **Data Privacy**: Keep all data on your own servers
- **Cost Control**: No per-session/per-message pricing - scale as much as you need
- **Integration**: Deep integration with your existing infrastructure

## Deployment Options

WAHA supports multiple deployment methods to fit different infrastructure needs.

All options are containerized - choose based on **how you want to manage it**.

### Docker
Use **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for consistent, portable deployments.

- **Management**: CLI and Compose files
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Maintenance**: Easy updates with image pulls and restarts
- **Cons**: You own uptime, backups, and monitoring; updates are manual

### EasyPanel

Use an intuitive **EasyPanel** interface to deploy, manage, and provision SSL certificates.

- **Management**: UI (point-and-click)
- **Complexity**: Low
- **Maintenance**: One-click updates, SSL, and monitoring from the panel
- **Cons**: Not open source; paid for more than 3 projects; less flexible than raw Compose

### Coolify

Use **Coolify** (open source) to deploy and manage containers via a UI.

- **Management**: UI (Git-based deploys and container management)
- **Complexity**: Low to Medium
- **Maintenance**: Updates from the dashboard, auto-deploys optional
