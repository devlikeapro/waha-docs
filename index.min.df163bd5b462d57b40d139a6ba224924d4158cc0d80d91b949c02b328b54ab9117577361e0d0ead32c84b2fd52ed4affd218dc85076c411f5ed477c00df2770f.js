Are you a visual learner? We\u0026rsquo;ve got you covered! Watch the video tutorial below to see how to send your first message using WAHA
Step 0. Requirements #WAHA works on top of Docker, that\u0026rsquo;s the only think you\u0026rsquo;ll need!
👉 Please follow the Docker official guides to install it on Linux, Windows, and macOS Why Docker?Docker makes it easy to ship all-in-one solution with the runtime and dependencies. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about language-specific libraries or chrome installation.
Also, Docker makes installation and update processes so simple, just one command!
Step 1. Download image #Assuming you have installed Docker, let\u0026rsquo;s download the image.
Run the command below:
docker pull devlikeapro/waha If you got the ➕ WAHA Plus , use the following commands:
docker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY} docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus docker logout ARM processors #If you\u0026rsquo;re using ARM (like Apple M1/M2, etc.) - use following commands to download the image:
# Download the image docker pull devlikeapro/waha:arm # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha:arm devlikeapro/waha If you got the ➕ WAHA Plus , use the following commands:
docker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY} docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm docker logout # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm devlikeapro/waha-plus Step 2. Run WAHA #Run WhatsApp HTTP API:
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000/tcp --name waha devlikeapro/waha # It prints logs and the last line must be # WhatsApp API is running on: http://[::1]:3000 👉 Now, open 📊 Dashboard at http://localhost:3000/dashboard You\u0026rsquo;ll see WAHA Dashboard: Step 3. Start a new session #To start a new session you should have your mobile phone with installed WhatsApp application close to you.
Here is the official instruction on WhatsApp site on how to log in.
Now you start default session (current status should be STOPPED).
You can leave all configuration parameters by default: Step 4. Get and scan QR #Wait until the session status is SCAN_QR and click on \u0026ldquo;camera\u0026rdquo; icon: 👉 If instead of QR you see Click to reload QR - stop the session and start it again.
You\u0026rsquo;ll see QR code from WhatsApp Web app, now get your phone with installed WhatsApp application and scan the QR: The session status will move to WORKING status: Step 5. Send a text message #Now we\u0026rsquo;re ready to send first messages to WhatsApp via API!
Replace 123123 with your phone number without +, but keep @c.us part:
curl -X 'POST' \\ 'http://localhost:3000/api/sendText' \\ -H 'accept: application/json' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \u0026quot;chatId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;123123@c.us\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;text\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Hi there!\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;session\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot; }' As alternative to curl, you can use 📚 Swagger for that.

It\u0026rsquo;s important to keep in mind that WhatsApp has strict policies in place to prevent spamming and abuse of their platform.
If you\u0026rsquo;re developing a bot for WhatsApp, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to follow these guidelines to avoid getting blocked.
Guidelines to Follow #1. Only Reply to Messages #When developing a bot for WhatsApp, you should never initiate a conversation. Instead, your bot should only reply to messages that it receives. This will prevent your bot from being flagged as spam by WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s users and algorithms.
You can use a short link http://wa.me/7911111111?text=Hi so a user can click on it and start the dialog with the bot first
2. Avoid Spamming and Sending Unnecessary Content #Sending too many messages or sending content that the user did not request can also lead to your bot being blocked. Make sure to only send relevant and useful information to the user. Additionally, do not send too many messages at once, as this can also trigger spam filters.
3. Other Considerations #There are other guidelines to follow when developing a bot for WhatsApp, such as avoiding the use of banned words and not sharing sensitive or inappropriate content. Make sure to read WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s policies thoroughly to ensure that your bot complies with all of their rules.
How to Process Messages #When processing messages in your bot, it\u0026rsquo;s important to follow certain steps to avoid being flagged as spam. Here\u0026rsquo;s a recommended process to follow:
Send seen before processing the message. This can be done by sending a POST /api/sendSeen/ request to the WAHA API.
Start typing before sending a message and wait for a random interval depending on the size of the message. This can be done by sending a POST /api/startTyping/ request.
Stop typing before sending the message. This can be done by sending a POST /api/stopTyping/ request.
Send the text message using the POST /api/sendText request.
By following these steps, you can ensure that your bot processes messages in a way that\u0026rsquo;s compliant with WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s guidelines and reduces the risk of being blocked.
How to not get Banned? #WhatsApp knows that it\u0026rsquo;s uncommon for someone to send so many messages or bulk messages to people they\u0026rsquo;ve never talked to each other before so it is considered spam/marketing junk pretty fast. There are some tips before sending a message to WhatsApp
Dos and Don\u0026rsquo;ts:
Important: Do NOT send messages which get you a report. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t get reports from users who you sent a message, your account will be mostly fine. Having real content, a survey that the person agreed with is different from a marketing message on a Saturday night. Send messages written in different ways, you could make a script that places spacebars randomly on your string AND includes the person\u0026rsquo;s (first) name Never use fixed times, always go for sending the first message, wait a random time between 30 ~ and 60 seconds and then send the second message Always try to group contacts by their area code, WhatsApp expects a regular person to talk mostly with contacts that are within the same area of your phone number. Have a profile picture, this is not related to WhatsApp Bots Catcher® but sending a new message for someone not having a picture/name/status will elevate your chances of being manually tagged as spam. Send \u0026ldquo;seen\u0026rdquo; confirmation to messages or disable it on WhatsApp Avoid sending links that were previously marked as spam on WhatsApp or non-HTTPS. A URL shortener is a good idea IMPORTANT: It\u0026rsquo;s terrible if you send messages 24/7 without giving it some time to wait. Random delays between messages are not enough, send a reasonable amount of messages keeping in mind your conversion rate, For example: for one hour send a maximum of 4 messages per contact that have replied to your message, and stop sending messages for one hour, then start again. Again, don\u0026rsquo;t send messages without stopping for a while between every \u0026ldquo;package\u0026rdquo; Send only one short message when starting a conversation, one should not send long texts or multiple messages without the user consenting Have in mind:
For every one you send a message that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have your number on their contact list asked if it\u0026rsquo;s spam, being tagged as spam a few times (5 - 10) will get you banned WhatsApp records every movement you do, you can even check the logs when sending simple support email, it contains all kinds of information, this said: act as human as possible Try to engage in conversations, as long as you send a message and the person doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically block you it\u0026rsquo;ll be quite okay. People constantly talking to you and adding you to their contact list will make your number stronger against a ban Think about that like a points system, you start with zero points (negative if your device was previously blacklisted), if you reach below zero you are out, if you engage in conversations you get a point, if you are tagged as spam you lose some points, if you are blocked you may lose more points Finally, If your content is spam, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you are using a broadcast list, group, or direct contact, you will still be banned As API, we say all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do right now is to agree with WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s policy, not send spam messages, and always wait for the other person to contact you first.
You could make it by sending an SMS to the person with a link to start a chat on WhatsApp with you by link https://wa.me/12132132131?text=Hi.

If you want to host more sessions - please check the numbers below
How much CPU and Memory does WAHA consume? #WAHA uses multiple 🏭 Engines under the hood and depends on the used engine CPU and Memory requirements change
WEBJS #The nature of WEBJS engine - it runs real WhatsApp Web version in Chromium (or Chrome) and communicate with it to prevent blocking from WhatsApp.
It\u0026rsquo;s the reason why it\u0026rsquo;s so demanding on resources.
Accounts (sessions) in the container CPU Memory 1 30% 400MB 10 270% 1.5GB 👉 The benchmark has been made on Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz. It may differ from case to case, it depends on usage pattern - how many messages you get, how many send, etc.
NOWEB #If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for less resource demanded engine - have a look at NOWEB engine -\u0026gt;
Accounts (sessions) in the container CPU Memory 1 10% 200MB 10 100% 2GB 100 200% 6GB 400 250% 28GB Quotes from the users:
The server has 2 CPU and 8GB of memory. Today we have 85 sessions in this instance.
400 sessions with 4CPU and 32RAM. It\u0026rsquo;s working fine.
WAHA Plus #What is the difference between WAHA Core and WAHA Plus? #It\u0026rsquo;s two versions of product we build:
WAHA Core
The free and open source project available for everyone. Supports automating a single WhatsApp Account (aka 🖥️ Sessions Sends and receives unlimited text messages. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any built-in 🔒 Security features, which means you need to make sure your infrastructure is secure. WAHA Plus
The full available through donations version of the project Supports unlimited 🖥️ Sessions Sends and receives multimedia messages (images, videos) Have built-in 🔒 Security features You can find the full comparison table on Pricing page.
What is the difference between Core, Plus and PRO tiers? #Core free tier (aka community edition) that you\u0026rsquo;re already in, and you can use WAHA Core for free! Plus tier allows you to have access to WAHA Plus docker image and enjoy all features available in the product! PRO tier also gives you access to WAHA Plus image AND WAHA Plus Source Code on GitHub , but also our team will pay additional attentions to your requests 🫶 You can find the full comparison table on Pricing page.
I want to purchase WAHA Plus (WAHA Pro), is it one time purchase? #According to Pricing page:
It doesn\u0026rsquo;t require monthly subscriptions, once installed on your server - it always works! (until WhatsApp made backward-incompatible changes, and you have to update the image, or you need to reinstall it on new server )
Meaning that the installed WAHA will continue to work even after you subscription got expired. Unfortunately, WhatsApp makes backward incompatible changes and when it happens we need to keep up and update the docker image, which means that you need to update your WAHA as well, otherwise it won\u0026rsquo;t work 😔 It happens like every 3-6 months or so and depends on your country as well.
In order to update WAHA you need to have active docker key (which you get on WAHA Patron Portal), meaning at this time you need to be active subscriber.
In summary, it\u0026rsquo;s not one time purchase, it\u0026rsquo;s rather \u0026ldquo;every 3-6 months\u0026rdquo; purchase to get the latest update.
💡 We recommend staying subscribing, so we can keep developing awesome product for you! Your support the only reason why we\u0026rsquo;re able to publish and maintain the project 🫶

Improvements on session management, restarting sessions and more:
Added WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True: Set this variable to True to start all STOPPED sessions after container restarts. By default, this variable is set to False. Please note that this will start all STOPPED sessions, not just the sessions that were working before the restart. You can maintain the session list by using POST /api/session/stop with the logout: True parameter or by calling POST /api/session/logout to remove STOPPED sessions. You can see all sessions, including STOPPED sessions, in the GET /api/sessions/all=True response. WHATSAPP_START_SESSION now support more than one session! Separate session names by command, and it\u0026rsquo;ll start them ALWAYS after container restart WHATSAPP_START_SESSION=session1,session2 WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_CONFIG_ADVANCED=true enables advanced configuration options for Swagger documentation - you can customize host, port and base URL for the requests. Disabled by default. Added ?all=true parameter to GET /api/session?all=True endpoint - it\u0026rsquo;ll show you ALL session, included **STOPPED **, so you can know which one will be restarted if you set WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True environment variable. Added POST /api/sessions/logout that allow you to logout from session - remove saved credentials. Added logout boolean parameter to POST /api/sessions/stop request that allow you to stop the session AND logout at the same time. Added engine field in webhook payload { \u0026quot;event\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;session\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;engine\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;WEBJS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;payload\u0026quot;: {} } 2023.5 #May 2023
Added new NOWEB engine. NOWEB engine does not require a browser to work with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a WebSocket. Less CPU and RAM usage! Send Locations API works! Send Link Preview API works! ⚠ Read the article before using it How to avoid blocking -\u0026gt;. 2023.4 #March 2023
Add Groups API Use Chromium by default instead of Chrome 2023.1 #January 2023
Added Contacts API Get all contacts Get a contact Get contact \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; (status) Get contact profile picture Check number exists (is registered in WhatsApp) - works even if the number is not in the contact list Block and unblock contact 2022.12 #December 2023
Added GET /messages/ endpoint to get chat messages #31 Added WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_USERNAME and WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_PASSWORD to hide and protect swagger panel. 2022.11 #Please test changes in test environment before update production!!
Engine WAHA has changed its underlying engine from Venom to Whatsapp Web.JS. It might change the response and webhook\u0026rsquo;s payloads. Optimize CPU and memory consumption. Requests For all /api/session/ requests use name field instead of sessionName. For all \u0026ldquo;chatting\u0026rdquo; requests use session field instead of sessionName. Sessions Now you don\u0026rsquo;t have to scan QR code each time you run WAHA, WAHA saves it for you! Available only in Plus version.
Authentication Now you can authenticate all requests for WAHA - use WHATSAPP_API_KEY=secret environment variable to set \u0026ldquo;secret key\u0026rdquo;.
If WHATSAPP_API_KEY is set - requests must have X-Api-Key header with secret value, where secret - any random secret key.
Webhooks Instead of setting each webhook via environment variables - we use two environments variables:
WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL - to set a URL WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS - to set events that are sent to the URL Previous Current WHATSAPP_HOOK_ONMESSAGE=https://httpbin.org/post WHATSAPP_HOOK_ONANYMESSAGE=https://httpbin.org/post WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=https://httpbin.org/post WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=message,message.any Webhook payload
The data for webhooks are wrapped inside a new WAWebhook object with event and payload fields to help you identify which handler you should call based on event.

Requirements #Docker 🐳 #👉 WAHA works on top of Docker, that\u0026rsquo;s the only thing you\u0026rsquo;ll need!
Docker - please follow the official guides to install it on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Docker Compose - optional, but recommended for easier configuration. Why Docker?Docker makes it easy to ship all-in-one solution with the runtime and dependencies. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about language-specific libraries or chrome installation.
Also, Docker makes installation and update processes so simple, just one command!
Why Docker Compose?Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application\u0026rsquo;s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. Choose the installation method #You probably already have run the docker run command during ⚡ Quick Start guide:
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000/tcp --name waha devlikeapro/waha ☝️ The above command is good for testing and development purposes, but not for production.
To make it production-ready, you need to configure few more parameters to make it secure, reliable, and easy to manage.
Please choose the installation method you prefer:
Docker Compose - recommended Docker - for advanced users Choose docker image #We\u0026rsquo;ll use ➕ WAHA Plus docker image in the examples:
docker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY} docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus docker logout If you\u0026rsquo;re using the ARM processor (like Apple Silicon, Apple M1, etc.) - add :arm tag at the end of the image name in the above commands.
\`\`\`bash docker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY} docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm docker logout # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm devlikeapro/waha-plus For WAHA Core - use devlikeapro/waha image instead of devlikeapro/waha-plus.
Docker Compose #Install #Here\u0026rsquo;s ready to go docker-compose.yml.

If you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet - please follow the steps from Quick Start →.
You must use Webhooks to receive messages from WhatsApp to your application.
Start a new session with configured message event in webhooks - call POST /api/sessions/start with the payload:
{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;config\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;webhooks\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;url\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://webhook.site/11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;events\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;message\u0026quot; ] } ] } } After that WAHA sends events (see below) about new messages to an endpoint you provided.
💡 You can open https://webhook.site and paste UUID from it to url field, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see all requests immediately in your browser to intercept the webhook\u0026rsquo;s payload.
Some IDS #You can see some in from, to, and participant fields here\u0026rsquo;s what they mean:
123123123@c.us Phone numbers accounts - international phone number without + at the start and add @c.us at the end.

Session persistent #If you want to save your session and do not scan QR code everytime when you launch WAHA - connect the session storage to the container -\u0026gt;
Autostart #If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to call POST /api/sessions/start for every session each time when the container restart - you can use set of these environment variables to start sessions for you:
WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True: Set this variable to True to start all STOPPED sessions after container restarts. By default, this variable is set to False. Please note that this will start all STOPPED sessions, not just the sessions that were working before the restart. You can maintain the session list by using POST /api/session/stop with the logout: True parameter or by calling POST /api/session/logout to remove STOPPED sessions. You can see all sessions, including STOPPED sessions, in the GET /api/sessions/all=True response. WHATSAPP_START_SESSION=session1,session2: This variable can be used to start sessions with the specified names right after launching the API. Separate session names with a comma. Multiple sessions #If you want to save server\u0026rsquo;s CPU and Memory - run multiple sessions inside one docker container! Plus version supports multiple sessions in one container.

Webhooks are a way for two different applications to communicate with each other in real-time. When a certain event happens in one application, it sends a message to another application through a webhook URL. The receiving application can then take action based on the information received.
Setup #Session webhooks #You can define webhooks configuration per session when you start it with POST /api/sessions/start request data.
Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple example:
{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;config\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;webhooks\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;url\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://webhook.site/11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;events\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;message\u0026quot; ] } ] } } Here\u0026rsquo;s available configuration options for webhooks

WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=https://webhook.site/11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111 - to set up a URL for the webhook WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=message,message.any,state.change - specify events. Do not specify all of them, it\u0026rsquo;s too heavy payload, choose the right for you. WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=* - subscribe to all events. It\u0026rsquo;s not recommended for production, but it\u0026rsquo;s fine for development. That webhook configuration does not appear in session.config field in GET /api/sessions/ request.
Connect Websockets #Alternatively, you can use Websockets to receive messages in real-time.
websocat -E ws://localhost:3000/ws 👉 Read more about it in the Websockets section below.
Webhook payload #On the URL that you set you\u0026rsquo;ll receive HTTP POST request with a JSON string with following format:
{ \u0026quot;event\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;message\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;session\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;engine\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;WEBJS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;environment\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;tier\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;PLUS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2023.10.12\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;me\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;71111111111@c.us\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pushName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;~\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;payload\u0026quot;: { } } Where event value helps you identify the incoming event with payload for that events.
Below the list of all events that WhatsApp API sends to your.
💡 You can open https://webhook.site and paste UUID from it to url field, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see all requests immediately in your browser to intercept the webhook\u0026rsquo;s payload.
Run the bellow command and see look at the logs - it prints body request for all events that happen in your WhatsApp!

It affects both WEBJS and NOWEB engines.
👉 If proxy doesn\u0026rsquo;t help but the project works on YOUR local laptop - check Tunneling.
Symptoms #You start a new session in WhatsApp. Scan the QR code. Experience a long loading time. Face login failures or instant logout. Encounter a new QR code or enter a FAILED state immediately. Solutions #There are two ways to solve this issue:
Use a proxy (read this page and article about WAHA + Geonode). Running WAHA on local network and expose WAHA with Ngrok. Configuration #There are two ways to set up proxies:
Global Setting (for all sessions per container) Per Session Configuration (you can define a proxy for each session when you start it) Global Proxy Configuration #To use a proxy, you can set the following environment variables:
WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER=localhost:3128: Set the proxy server in the format host:port, without HTTP or HTTPS. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_USERNAME=username and WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_PASSWORD=password: Configure credentials for the proxy. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_LIST=host1.example.com:3138,host2.example.com:3138: Specify a comma-separated list of addresses to use, utilizing a round-robin algorithm for server selection. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_INDEX_PREFIX=proxy-: Define a session name prefix to choose the appropriate proxy from the list. Read more about it on Configuration page -\u0026gt;.
Session Proxy Configuration #You can configure proxy for a session by setting config.proxy fields when you POST /api/sessions/start:
server - proxy server address, without http:// or https:// prefixes username and password - set this if the proxy requires authentication No authentication
{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;config\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;proxy\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;server\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;localhost:3128\u0026quot; } } } Proxy with authentication

Recommended Proxies #Geonode #We recommend using Geonode.
Proxy6 #Another option is Proxy6 where you can get a dedicated proxy (only you\u0026rsquo;ll use it) for \$1.77 per month.
👉 Unfortunately, it uses VPS IP ranges, so doesn't work 100% Apply the promocode get a 5% discount on your purchase.
9W9oVxx3UX Tunneling #If you can\u0026rsquo;t use a proxy (or it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help), you can try tunneling the connection to your local machine.
You can run WAHA on local network then, you can buy something like RaspberryPi or a small server (lenovo m93 or similar) and host it there.
So the setup would look like:
You have an app (with your logic and database) running on VPS You have WAHA running on your local network on some dedicated PC (mongodb or file MUST be placed on this server as well) You have ngrok (or any similar reverse proxy) running on local network and sharing 3000 port on dedicated name (paid ngrok required for that) Your App communicated with WAHA API using the external ngrok name and WAHA send webhooks back to the server There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can do about network detection from Meta side :(

poll.vote #With this event, you receive new votes for the poll sent.
Vote from a user in direct messages. #{ \u0026quot;event\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;poll.vote\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;session\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;payload\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;vote\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;false_1111111111@c.us_83ACBE602A05C79B234B54415E95EE8A\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;me\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1111111@c.us\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;fromMe\u0026quot;: false, \u0026quot;selectedOptions\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;Awesome!\u0026quot; ], \u0026quot;timestamp\u0026quot;: 1692861427 }, \u0026quot;poll\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;true_1111111111@c.us_BAE5F2EF5C69001E\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;to\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1111111111@c.us\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;from\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;me\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;fromMe\u0026quot;: true } }, \u0026quot;engine\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NOWEB\u0026quot; } Do I receive votes only for my polls? #No, you receive all votes. Keep in mind that you\u0026rsquo;ll get all votes with this event, even from other polls. To identify that it\u0026rsquo;s your poll, look at the poll.fromMe field.
How to handle multiple-answer votes #For multipleAnswers: true, you receive the selectedOptions with all the selected values at a certain moment. So if a user has chosen 3 options from the poll, you will receive 3 poll.vote events:
selectedOptions: [\u0026quot;First\u0026quot;] selectedOptions: [\u0026quot;First\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Second\u0026quot;] selectedOptions: [\u0026quot;First\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Second\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Third\u0026quot;] Timestamp #If a user clicks on the poll multiple times, you will receive multiple poll.vote events. This is true for both multipleAnswers: false (when a user changes their mind about answers) and multipleAnswers: true (when a user selects two or more options) events.
There is a little chance that you may receive votes in the wrong order (due to the nature of HTTP and Webhooks), like 1-3-2 instead of 1-2-3. To determine the right order, look at the timestamp field. The event with a higher timestamp value is more recent.
👉 It\u0026rsquo;s important to save the timestamp for each vote in your database and compare them as numbers, without converting to internal datetime. Right now, the timestamp shows the timestamp in seconds, but it may be changed to milliseconds in the future.

Later, when you receive a poll.vote.failed event, find the id for the poll in the database and repeat the same question to the user, apologizing for the inconvenience. For example, you can say:
Sorry, we don\u0026rsquo;t understand your choice 😞
Please click one more time on the message below 👇
After the user clicks on the poll again, you will receive a poll.vote event with their choice.
How to test poll.vote.failed events? #To receive poll.vote.failed events, follow these steps:
Start a session and authorize it with a QR code. Send a poll to a chat. Stop the session (logout is not required). Start the session again. Vote on the poll. You will receive a poll.vote.failed event. Why does the poll.vote.failed event occur and when will it be fixed? #The issue occurs because WAHA does not have a proper storage system, but polls require proper storage in order to decrypt votes later.
There will be two fixes for this:
In the short term, a local file storage will be used to save poll keys. In the long term, work is being done on remote storages. Even after these fixes are implemented, it\u0026rsquo;s better to handle poll.vote.failed events anyway, so your application is prepared for such cases!

You should use the GET /api/contacts/check-exists endpoint before sending a message to a new phone number to get the correct chatId because of the additional 9-digit number added after 2012.
Read more about error sending text to half of Brazilian numbers (every number registered before 2012) -\u0026gt;
It\u0026rsquo;s fine to send the response to chatId for incoming messages, though - the payload already has the correct chatId.

WEBJS #👉 Read more about WEBJS
WHATSAPP_DEFAULT_ENGINE=WEBJS
A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app. It uses Puppeteer to run a real instance of Whatsapp Web to avoid getting blocked.
NOWEB #👉 Read more about NOWEB
WHATSAPP_DEFAULT_ENGINE=NOWEB
NOWEB engine does not require a browser to work with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a WebSocket. Not running Chromium saves you CPU and Memory, so you can run more instances on a single server!
Quotes from the users:
The server has 2 CPU and 8GB of memory. Today we have 85 sessions in this instance.
400 sessions with 4CPU and 32RAM. It\u0026rsquo;s working fine.
VENOM #👉 Read more about VENOM

Sessions #WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True: Set this variable to True to start all STOPPED sessions after container restarts. By default, this variable is set to False. Please note that this will start all STOPPED sessions, not just the sessions that were working before the restart. You can maintain the session list by using POST /api/session/stop with the logout: True parameter or by calling POST /api/session/logout to remove STOPPED sessions. You can see all sessions, including STOPPED sessions, in the GET /api/sessions/all=True response. WAHA_PRINT_QR=True - set this variable to False to disable printing QR codes to the console.

Proxy #Global proxy #If you need to use a proxy, you can set the following environment variables:
WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER=localhost:3128: Use this variable to set the proxy server in the format host:port, without http or https. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_USERNAME=username and WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_PASSWORD=password: Use these variables to set up credentials for the proxy. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_LIST=host1.example.com:3138,host2.example.com:3138: Use this variable to set a comma-separated list of addresses to use, using a round-robin algorithm to choose the server for the session. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_INDEX_PREFIX=proxy-: Use this variable to parse the session name for the prefix and find the appropriate session. For example, if you have set WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_LIST=host-first:80,host-second:80,host-third:80 and WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_INDEX_PREFIX=proxy- and you run proxy-3 session, the host-third:80 proxy will be chosen for that session. This is a way to select a proxy from while you start session. Session proxy #You can configure proxy when you start session by setting config.proxy fields. Read more about it on Session page -\u0026gt;.
Keep in mind that session\u0026rsquo;s proxy configuration takes precedence over proxy configuration set by environment variables!
HTTPS #WAHA_HTTPS_ENABLED=true: Set this variable to true to enable HTTPS. By default, it\u0026rsquo;s false. WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_KEY=/path/to/key.pem: The path to the key file for HTTPS.

WHATSAPP_API_KEY=mysecret: If you set this variable, you must include the X-Api-Key: mysecret header in all requests to the API. This will protect the API with a secret code. WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_USERNAME=admin and WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_PASSWORD=admin: These variables can be used to protect the Swagger panel with admin / admin credentials. This does not affect API access. Read more about security settings for Swagger and API on Security page -\u0026gt;.
Files #Files configuration is available in WAHA Plus only.
The following environment variables can be used to configure the file storage options for the WAHA:
WHATSAPP_FILES_MIMETYPES: This variable can be used to download only specific mimetypes from messages. By default, all files are downloaded. The mimetypes must be separated by a comma, without spaces. For example: audio,image/png,image/gif. To choose a specific type, use a prefix (like audio,image). See usage below. WHATSAPP_DOWNLOAD_MEDIA=true - this variable can be used to completely disable downloading media files. By default, all files are downloaded. Set this variable to WHATSAPP_DOWNLOAD_MEDIA=false to disable downloading media files. Under the hood, it sets WHATSAPP_FILES_MIMETYPES=mimetype/ignore-all-media to ignore all media files. WHATSAPP_FILES_LIFETIME: This variable can be used to set the time (in seconds) after which files will be removed to free up space. The default value is 180. Set this variable to 0 to disable the file lifetime. WHATSAPP_FILES_FOLDER: This variable can be used to set the folder where files from chats (images, voice messages) will be stored. The default value is /tmp/whatsapp-files. The folder must be mounted to the host machine to keep the files between container restarts.

How to Use Docker Compose #Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It simplifies the process of managing multiple containers and their dependencies. In this topic, we will walk you through how to use Docker Compose with the WhatsApp API.
Prerequisites #Before you start, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can download Docker from the official website here. Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS, but for Linux, you need to install it separately. You can find the installation instructions here.
Getting Started #To get started, you need to clone the docker-compose.yaml file to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlikeapro/waha/core/docker-compose.yaml Running the WhatsApp API Service #To start the waha service, run the following command:
docker-compose up -d waha This will start the container in detached mode and map port 3000 to 3000 on the host machine.
To stop the service, run the command:
docker-compose down This will stop and remove the container.
To restart the service, run the command:
docker-compose restart whtasapp-http-api This will restart the container.
Viewing the Logs #To view the logs for the waha service, run the command:
docker-compose logs -f waha This will show the logs in real-time. To view the logs for the waha-plus service, replace waha with waha-plus.
To view the logs for a specific period, run the command:
docker-compose logs --since \u0026lt;time\u0026gt; Replace \u0026lt;time\u0026gt; with the time period you want to view the logs for. For example, docker-compose logs --since 1h will show the logs for the past hour.
Using the WhatsApp API Services #There are two services provided in the docker-compose.yml file - waha and waha-plus. It is important to note that these services must not be run at the same time. By default, the waha service will be used.
To use the waha-plus service, you need to specify it in the command.

Store under the hood #Under the hood, the NOWEB stores the session data in database based on 🗄️ Storage you choose - either in files or in MongoDB.
For File local storage it creates sqlite3 database at .sessions/noweb/{sessionName}/store.sqlite3 store with chats, contacts, messages tables with proper indexes. 👉 We don\u0026rsquo;t recommend opening it manually when the session is running, even for reading, it can lead to the loss of the chat history. For MongoDB in waha_{engine}_{sessionName} it creates chats, contacts, messages collections with proper indexes. 👉 You can safely READ from the database, but DO NOT WRITE to it manually, it can lead to the loss of the chat history.

Local (files) - the default option, stores the session data in the local storage using files. MongoDB - stores the session data in the MongoDB database. The following table shows the compatibility of the session storage with the engines:
WEBJS NOWEB VENOM Local (files) ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ MongoDB ✔️ ✔️ ➖ Sessions - Local (files) #By default, the WAHA uses the local storage (files) to store the session data.
💡 It's well tested solution even for production In order to use the local storage and save the session data between the container restarts, you need to mount the volume to the /app/.sessions directory using the -v option in docker run command:
-v /path/to/on/host/.sessions:/app/.sessions The full command to run the WAHA with the local storage and save the session data in the current directory and .sessions directory:
docker run -v \`pwd\`/.sessions:/app/.sessions -p 3000:3000/tcp devlikeapro/waha-plus This is the only action you need to do to use the local storage - all session data will be available between the container restarts.
How it works #In the host machine, the session data will be stored in the current directory in the .sessions directory.
Under the hood, the WAHA stores the session data in the following directory structure:
.sessions/{engine}/{sessionName}/... when you \u0026ldquo;logout\u0026rdquo; the session using POST /api/sessions/logout or providing logout: True in POST /api/sessions/stop it removes the directory with the session data.
Health Check #The WAHA Plus provides the health check endpoint that checks the local storage.
Sessions - MongoDB #If you want to use the MongoDB to store the session data, you need to:
Start the MongoDB server (using docker or any other way). You can either start your own MongoDB server or use the one of cloud providers, like MongoDB Atlas. Set WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_MONGO_URL=mongodb://user:password@host:port/ environment variable to connect to the MongoDB server. We recommend using your own MongoDB server as close as possible to WAHA server for the best performance and security reasons.
💡 For WEBJS engine it can take up to 1 minute to save credentials in Mongo Database Example #First, you need to start MongoDB server:
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo Then, you need to run the WAHA with the WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_MONGO_URL environment variable (please note using --network host option as well)
docker run -e WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/ --network host devlikeapro/waha-plus This is the only action you need to do to use the MongoDB storage - all session authentication data will be stored in the MongoDB database.
How it works #When you start a session, it stores the session data in the MongoDB database in two databases:
waha_{engine} - it saves the session configuration in sessions collection with name: {sessionName} field. waha_{engine}_{sessionName} - it saves the WhatsApp authentication data and other session data. Each engine saves different data in this database. When you \u0026ldquo;logout\u0026rdquo; the session using POST /api/sessions/logout or providing logout: True in POST /api/sessions/stop it removes those databases or elements from them.
For dealing and troubleshooting with the MongoDB, we recommend using MongoDB Compass.
MongoDB Atlas #If you use the MongoDB Atlas you must grant Atlas Admin role in Security =\u0026gt; Database Access before you connect to the database.
For production please consider running the MongoDB server close to the WAHA server for the best performance and security reasons.
Health Check #The WAHA Plus provides the health check endpoint that checks the MongoDB connection.
Media #When your WhatsApp instance receives media files, it stores them in the media storage.
You can use the following options to store the media files:
Local - the default option, stores the media files in the local storage using files. S3 - stores the media files in the S3 storage. Read more about available configuration options -\u0026gt;.
The following table shows the compatibility of the storage with the engines:
WEBJS NOWEB VENOM Local ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ S3 🕒 🕒 ➖ Media - Local #By default, the WAHA uses the local file storage to store the media files and those files has a short lifetime (180 seconds). So it\u0026rsquo;s your app responsibility to download and store them in a safe persistent place during this time.
Save media files between the container restarts #If you want to use the local storage and save the media files between the container restarts for a long time - you need to:
Specify a dedicated folder to store the media files using WHATSAPP_FILES_FOLDER=/app/.media environment variable Disable automatic media files cleanup using WHATSAPP_FILES_LIFETIME=0 environment variable Connect the volume to the specified folder using the -v /path/to/files/on/host:/app/.media option in docker run command to the folder specified in WHATSAPP_FILES_FOLDER environment variable. Read more about available configuration options -\u0026gt;.
Here\u0026rsquo;s all the steps in one command:
docker run -v /path/to/on/host/.media:/app/.media -e WHATSAPP_FILES_FOLDER=/app/.media -e WHATSAPP_FILES_LIFETIME=0 -p 3000:3000/tcp devlikeapro/waha-plus Health Check #The WAHA Plus provides the health check endpoint that checks the local storage.
Media - S3 #If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in using the S3 storage or any other cloud storage (like self-hosted S3 - Minio), please create an issue or vote for the S3 issue in the GitHub repository.
