We\u0026rsquo;ve got you covered! Watch the video tutorial below to see how to send your first message using WAHA\nStep 0. Requirements WAHA works on top of Docker, that\u0026rsquo;s the only thing you\u0026rsquo;ll need!\n👉 Please follow the Docker official guides to install it on Linux, Windows, and macOS Why Docker?\rDocker makes it easy to ship an all-in-one solution with the runtime and dependencies. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about language-specific libraries or Chrome installation.\nAlso, Docker makes installation and update processes so simple, just one command!\nStep 1. Download image Assuming you have installed Docker, let\u0026rsquo;s download the image! Follow the instructions below:\nWAHA Core ➕ WAHA Plus WAHA (ARM) Run the command below:\ndocker pull devlikeapro/waha\rIf you got the ➕ WAHA Plus , use the following commands:\ndocker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY} docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus docker logout\r👉 Go to Docker Image Configurator to generate the command with the right version.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using ARM (like Apple M1/M2, Raspberry Pi etc.) - use following commands to download the image:\n# Download the image docker pull devlikeapro/waha:arm # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha:arm devlikeapro/waha\rIf you got the ➕ WAHA Plus , use the following commands:\ndocker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY} docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm docker logout # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm devlikeapro/waha-plus\r👉 Go to Docker Image Configurator to generate the command with the right version.\nStep 2. Init WAHA Generate a .env file that we\u0026rsquo;ll use in the next step for credentials:\nInit WAHA\rdocker run --rm -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/app/env devlikeapro/waha init-waha /app/env\rInit WAHA (Output)\rCredentials generated. Dashboard and Swagger: - Username: admin - Password: 11111111111111111111111111111111 API key: - 00000000000000000000000000000000 Use it in the Dashboard connection flow: https://waha.devlike.pro/docs/how-to/dashboard/#api-key\rRemember these values (you can always check the .env file if you forget them):\nUsername / Password: admin / 11...11 - use them to access the Dashboard and Swagger UI Api Key: 00...00 - use it to connect to your server 👉 You can change variables to any values, but use long strings (like UUIDv4)\nStep 3. Run WAHA Run WhatsApp HTTP API:\ndocker run -it --env-file \u0026#34;$(pwd)/.env\u0026#34; -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)/sessions:/app/.sessions\u0026#34; --rm -p 3000:3000 --name waha devlikeapro/waha\rNot a Production-Ready Installation!\n☝️ The above command is meant only for initial testing, not for production use.\nPlease follow the 🔧 Install \u0026amp; Update guide to set up a secure WAHA instance after you finish the quick start guide.\nNow, open the 📊 Dashboard at http://localhost:3000/dashboard Use username/password from the previous step (.env file - WAHA_DASHBOARD_USERNAME / WAHA_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD):\nNext, connect to the server using api key from the previous step (.env file - WAHA_API_KEY):\nStep 4. Start a new session To start a new session, you should have your mobile phone with the WhatsApp application installed close to you.\nHere is the official instruction on WhatsApp site on how to log in.\nNow you can start the default session (current status should be STOPPED).\nYou can leave all configuration parameters as default:\nStep 5. Get and scan QR Wait until the session status is SCAN_QR and click on the \u0026ldquo;camera\u0026rdquo; icon: 👉 If instead of the QR you see Click to reload QR - stop the session and start it again.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see the QR code from the WhatsApp Web app. Now get your phone with the WhatsApp application installed and scan the QR:\nThe session status will move to WORKING status:\nStep 6. Send a text message Now we\u0026rsquo;re ready to send the first messages to WhatsApp via the API!\nReplace 123123 with your phone number without +, but keep the @c.us part. Use the API key from your .env file (WAHA_API_KEY).

Only Reply to Messages When developing a bot for WhatsApp, you should never initiate a conversation. Instead, your bot should only reply to messages that it receives. This will prevent your bot from being flagged as spam by WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s users and algorithms.\nYou can use a short link http://wa.me/7911111111?text=Hi so a user can click on it and start the dialog with the bot first\n2. Avoid Spamming and Sending Unnecessary Content Sending too many messages or sending content that the user did not request can lead to your bot being blocked. Make sure to only send relevant and useful information to the user. Additionally, do not send too many messages at once, as this can also trigger spam filters.\n3. Other Considerations There are other guidelines to follow when developing a bot for WhatsApp, such as avoiding the use of banned words and not sharing sensitive or inappropriate content. Make sure to read WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s policies thoroughly to ensure that your bot complies with all of their rules.\nHow to Process Messages When processing messages in your bot, it\u0026rsquo;s important to follow certain steps to avoid being flagged as spam. Here\u0026rsquo;s a recommended process to follow:\nSend seen before processing the message. This can be done by sending a POST /api/sendSeen/ request to the WAHA API.\nStart typing before sending a message and wait for a random interval depending on the size of the message. This can be done by sending a POST /api/startTyping/ request.\nStop typing before sending the message. This can be done by sending a POST /api/stopTyping/ request.\nSend the text message using the POST /api/sendText request.\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your bot processes messages in a way that\u0026rsquo;s compliant with WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s guidelines and reduces the risk of being blocked.\nHow to Avoid Getting Banned WhatsApp knows that it\u0026rsquo;s uncommon for someone to send so many messages or bulk messages to people they\u0026rsquo;ve never talked to before, so it is considered spam/marketing junk pretty quickly. Here are some tips before sending a message to WhatsApp:\nDos and Don\u0026rsquo;ts:\nImportant: Do NOT send messages which get you reported. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t get reports from users who you sent a message to, your account will be mostly fine. Having real content, a survey that the person agreed with is different from a marketing message on a Saturday night. Send messages written in different ways; you could make a script that places spacebars randomly in your string AND includes the person\u0026rsquo;s (first) name. Never use fixed times; always go for sending the first message, wait a random time between 30 and 60 seconds, and then send the second message. Always try to group contacts by their area code; WhatsApp expects a regular person to talk mostly with contacts that are within the same area of your phone number. Have a profile picture; this is not related to WhatsApp Bots Catcher® but sending a new message to someone without having a picture/name/status will elevate your chances of being manually tagged as spam. Send \u0026ldquo;seen\u0026rdquo; confirmation to messages or disable it on WhatsApp. Avoid sending links that were previously marked as spam on WhatsApp or non-HTTPS. A URL shortener is a good idea. IMPORTANT: It\u0026rsquo;s terrible if you send messages 24/7 without giving it some time to wait. Random delays between messages are not enough; send a reasonable amount of messages keeping in mind your conversion rate. For example: for one hour, send a maximum of 4 messages per contact that have replied to your message, and stop sending messages for one hour, then start again. Again, don\u0026rsquo;t send messages without stopping for a while between every \u0026ldquo;package\u0026rdquo;. Send only one short message when starting a conversation; one should not send long texts or multiple messages without the user\u0026rsquo;s consent. Keep in mind:\nFor every message you send to someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have your number in their contact list, they are asked if it\u0026rsquo;s spam. Being tagged as spam a few times (5-10) will get you banned. WhatsApp records every movement you make; you can even check the logs when sending a simple support email. It contains all kinds of information, so act as human as possible. Try to engage in conversations; as long as you send a message and the person doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically block you, it\u0026rsquo;ll be quite okay. People constantly talking to you and adding you to their contact list will make your number stronger against a ban. Think about it like a points system: you start with zero points (negative if your device was previously blacklisted). If you reach below zero, you are out. If you engage in conversations, you get a point. If you are tagged as spam, you lose some points. If you are blocked, you may lose more points. Finally, if your content is spam, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you are using a broadcast list, group, or direct contact; you will still be banned. As an API, we say all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do right now is to agree with WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s policy, not send spam messages, and always wait for the other person to contact you first.\nYou could do this by sending an SMS to the person with a link to start a chat on WhatsApp with you by link https://wa.me/12132132131?text=Hi.\n","date":"2020-11-12","id":3,"permalink":"/docs/overview/%EF%B8%8F-how-to-avoid-blocking/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow to Avoid Blocking in WhatsApp when developing bots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s important to keep in mind that WhatsApp has strict policies in place to prevent spamming and abuse of their\nplatform.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"⚠️ How to Avoid Blocking"},{"content":"System Requirements How much CPU and Memory does WAHA need?

See ⚙️ Configuration → Sessions - Device Name.\nPairing code limitations\nCustom device names are applied only for the QR scan flow. Pairing code auth is likely to fail if a custom device name is set.\nUse a real browser name\nWe recommend changing only the device name and keeping a real browser name: Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari, Edge.\nMetadata metadata is an attribute on Session objects that lets you store more information, structured as key-value pairs, to sessions for your own use and reference. For example, you can store your user’s unique identifier from your system.\nAssociated metadata field is available in:\nList Sessions and Get Session responses 🔄 Events events 📊 Dashboard for view, and search sessions by metadata { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;user.id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;user.email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;email@example.com\u0026#34; } } }\rSample metadata use cases:\nLink IDs: Attach your system’s unique IDs to a Session object to simplify lookups. For example, add your user or tenant id. Customer details: Annotate a customer by storing an internal information (email, customer name) for your future use, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to look into two systems.

WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=* - subscribe to all events. We don\u0026rsquo;t suggest using * or all events for production, it can generate a lot of requests. WHATSAPP_HOOK_HMAC_KEY=your-secret-key - the same as hmac.key field in the webhook configuration. WHATSAPP_HOOK_RETRIES_POLICY=linear - the same as retries.policy field in the webhook configuration. WHATSAPP_HOOK_RETRIES_DELAY_SECONDS=2 - the same as retries.delaySeconds field in the webhook configuration. WHATSAPP_HOOK_RETRIES_ATTEMPTS=4 WHATSAPP_HOOK_CUSTOM_HEADERS=X-My-Custom-Header-1:Value;X-My-Custom-Header-2:Value - the same as customHeaders field in the webhook configuration. Use Header:Value format and separate them by ;. That webhook configuration does not appear in session.config field in GET /api/sessions/ request.\n💡 You can open https://webhook.site and paste URL from it to url field, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see all requests immediately in your browser to intercept the webhook\u0026rsquo;s payload.\nRetries You can configure retry policy for webhooks by settings config.retries structure when POST /api/sessions/:\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;webhooks\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://webhook.site/11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;events\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;message\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;retries\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;policy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;constant\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;delaySeconds\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;attempts\u0026#34;: 15 } } ] } }\rPossible policy:\nconstant - retry with the same delay between attempts (2, 2, 2, 2) linear - retry with linear backoff (2, 4, 6, 8) exponential - retry with exponential backoff with 20% jitter (2, 4.1, 8.4, 16.3). Headers When you receive a webhook request to your API endpoint, you\u0026rsquo;ll get those headers:\nX-Webhook-Request-Id - unique request id for each webhook request. X-Webhook-Timestamp - Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the webhook was sent. If you\u0026rsquo;re using HMAC authentication you\u0026rsquo;ll get two additional headers:\nX-Webhook-Hmac - message authentication code for the raw body in HTTP POST request that send to your endpoint. X-Webhook-Hmac-Algorithm - sha512 - algorithm that have been used to create X-Webhook-Hmac value. You can send any customer headers by defining config.webhooks.customHeaders fields this way:\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;webhooks\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://webhook.site/11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;events\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;message\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;customHeaders\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;X-My-Custom-Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34; } ] } ] } }\rHMAC authentication You can authenticate webhook sender by using HMAC Authentication.\nDefine you secret key in config.hmac.key field when you start session with POST /api/sessions/: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;webhooks\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://webhook.site/11111111-1111-1111-1111-11111111\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;events\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;message\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;hmac\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-secret-key\u0026#34; } } ] } }\rAfter that you\u0026rsquo;ll receive all webhooks payload with two additional headers: X-Webhook-Hmac - message authentication code for the raw body in HTTP POST request that send to your endpoint. X-Webhook-Hmac-Algorithm - sha512 - algorithm that have been used to create X-Webhook-Hmac value. Implement the authentication algorithm by hashing body and using secret key and then verifying it with X-Webhook-Hmac value.

WhatsApp. Scan the QR code. Experience a long loading time. Face login failures or instant logout. Encounter a new QR code or enter a FAILED state immediately. Solutions There are two ways to solve this issue:\nUse a proxy (read this page and article about WAHA + Geonode). Running WAHA on local network and expose WAHA with Ngrok. Configuration There are two ways to set up proxies:\nGlobal Setting (for all sessions per container) Per Session Configuration (you can define a proxy for each session when you start it) Global Proxy Configuration To use a proxy, you can set the following environment variables:\nWHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER=localhost:3128: Set the proxy server in the format host:port, without HTTP or HTTPS. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_USERNAME=username and WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_PASSWORD=password: Configure credentials for the proxy. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_LIST=host1.example.com:3138,host2.example.com:3138: Specify a comma-separated list of addresses to use, utilizing a round-robin algorithm for server selection. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_INDEX_PREFIX=proxy-: Define a session name prefix to choose the appropriate proxy from the list. Read more about it on Configuration page -\u0026gt;.\nSession Proxy Configuration You can configure proxy for a session by setting config.proxy fields when you POST /api/sessions/:\nserver - proxy server address, without http:// or https:// prefixes username and password - set this if the proxy requires authentication No authentication\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;proxy\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;localhost:3128\u0026#34; } } }\rProxy with authentication\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;proxy\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;localhost:3128\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;P@ssw0rd\u0026#34; } } }\rRead more about it on Sessions page -\u0026gt;.\nRecommended Proxies Proxy6 👉 Proxy6\nApply the promo code to get a 5% OFF Discount on your purchase.\n9W9oVxx3UX\rGeonode 👉 Geonode\nApply the promo code to get a 5% OFF Discount on your purchase.\nGEONODEAFF\rIt might reconnect the session due to its internal geonode issues - #751 Tunneling If you can\u0026rsquo;t use a proxy (or it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help), you can try tunneling the connection to your local machine.\nYou can run WAHA on local network then, you can buy something like RaspberryPi or a small server (lenovo m93 or similar) and host it there.\nSo the setup would look like:\nYou have an app (with your logic and database) running on VPS You have WAHA running on your local network on some dedicated PC (mongodb or file MUST be placed on this server as well) You have ngrok (or any similar reverse proxy) running on local network and sharing 3000 port on dedicated name (paid ngrok required for that) Your App communicated with WAHA API using the external ngrok name and WAHA send webhooks back to the server There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can do about network detection from Meta side :(\n","date":"2020-10-06","id":15,"permalink":"/docs/how-to/proxy/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing issues scanning QR codes in WhatsApp, especially with \u003cstrong\u003eIndian 🇮🇳 phone numbers\u003c/strong\u003e,\nusing a proxy located close to the phone number\u0026rsquo;s location may help resolve the problem.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"🌐 Proxy"},{"content":"📶 Polls in WhatsApp is a good alternative for buttons and other interactive messages.\nYou can ask a question and provide a few options for the user to choose from.

No, you receive all votes. Keep in mind that you\u0026rsquo;ll get all votes with this event, even from other polls. To identify that it\u0026rsquo;s your poll, look at the poll.fromMe field.\nHow to handle multiple-answer votes For multipleAnswers: true, you receive the selectedOptions with all the selected values at a certain moment. So if a user has chosen 3 options from the poll, you will receive 3 poll.vote events:\nselectedOptions: [\u0026quot;First\u0026quot;] selectedOptions: [\u0026quot;First\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Second\u0026quot;] selectedOptions: [\u0026quot;First\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Second\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Third\u0026quot;] Timestamp If a user clicks on the poll multiple times, you will receive multiple poll.vote events. This is true for both multipleAnswers: false (when a user changes their mind about answers) and multipleAnswers: true (when a user selects two or more options) events.\nThere is a little chance that you may receive votes in the wrong order (due to the nature of HTTP and Webhooks), like 1-3-2 instead of 1-2-3. To determine the right order, look at the timestamp field. The event with a higher timestamp value is more recent.\n👉 It\u0026rsquo;s important to save the timestamp for each vote in your database and compare them as numbers, without converting to internal datetime. Right now, the timestamp shows the timestamp in seconds, but it may be changed to milliseconds in the future.\nVote from a user in a group poll.vote\r{ \u0026#34;event\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;poll.vote\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;session\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;payload\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;vote\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;false_3333333333333@g.us_1C18A7EAADD2A8D0324755D241C4238A\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;to\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3333333333333@g.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;from\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1111111111@c.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fromMe\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;selectedOptions\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Awesome!\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: 1692861427 }, \u0026#34;poll\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;true_3333333333333@g.us_BAE5304BA1ECF704\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;to\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;33333333333333@g.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;from\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;222222222@c.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fromMe\u0026#34;: true } }, \u0026#34;engine\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NOWEB\u0026#34; }\rpoll.vote.failed There may be cases when WAHA fails to decrypt a vote from the user.

When you send a poll, save the poll configuration (question and options) in your database with the id field from the response you received from POST /api/sendPoll.\nLater, when you receive a poll.vote.failed event, find the id for the poll in the database and repeat the same question to the user, apologizing for the inconvenience. For example, you can say:\nSorry, we don\u0026rsquo;t understand your choice 😞\nPlease click one more time on the message below 👇\nAfter the user clicks on the poll again, you will receive a poll.vote event with their choice.\nHow to test poll.vote.failed events? To receive poll.vote.failed events, follow these steps:\nStart a session and authorize it with a QR code. Send a poll to a chat. Stop the session (logout is not required). Start the session again. Vote on the poll. You will receive a poll.vote.failed event. Why does the poll.vote.failed event occur and when will it be fixed? The issue occurs because WAHA does not have a proper storage system, but polls require proper storage in order to decrypt votes later.\nThere will be two fixes for this:\nIn the short term, a local file storage will be used to save poll keys. In the long term, work is being done on remote storages. Even after these fixes are implemented, it\u0026rsquo;s better to handle poll.vote.failed events anyway, so your application is prepared for such cases!\n","date":"2020-10-06","id":16,"permalink":"/docs/how-to/polls/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/docs/how-to/polls/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e📶 Polls\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\nin WhatsApp is a good alternative for buttons and other interactive messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can ask a question and provide a few options for the user to choose from.\nThe user can select only one option or multiple options, depending on the poll configuration.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"📶 Polls"},{"content":"Chats methods.\nFeatures Here\u0026rsquo;s the list of features that are available by 🏭 Engines:\n💬 Chats - API\rAPI WEBJS GOWS NOWEB Get all chats GET /api/{session}/chats ✔️ ✔️ ✔️¹ Get chats overview GET /api/{session}/chats/overview ✔️ ✔️ ✔️¹ Get chat picture GET /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/picture ✔️ ✔️ ✔️¹ Unread chat POST /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/unread ✔️ ✔️ ✔️¹ Archive chat POST /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/archive ✔️ ✔️¹ Unarchive chat POST /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/unarchive ✔️ ✔️¹ Delete chat DELETE /api/{session}/chats/{chatId} ✔️ Read messages POST /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/messages/read ✔️ ✔️ ✔️¹ Get messages GET /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/messages ✔️ ✔️ ✔️¹ Get message by id GET /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId} ✔️ ✔️ ✔️¹ Pin message POST /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}/pin ✔️ ✔️ Unpin message POST /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}/unpin ✔️ ✔️ Edit message PUT /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId} ✔️ ✔️ Delete message DELETE /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId} ✔️ ✔️ Delete all messages DELETE /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/messages ✔️ NOWEB - you need to Enable Store to get chats, contacts and messages If you see the feature is not available in the above list, please create a feature request or leave \u0026ldquo;+1\u0026rdquo; comment on the existing one.\n💬 Chats - Events\rEvents WEBJS NOWEB GOWS chat.archive ✔️ API Parameters in path that you can find in below endpoints:\n{session} - use the session name for Whatsapp instance that you created with POST /api/sessions endpoint {chatId} - chat id in format 123123123123@[c.us|g.us], c.us for direct chats and g.us for groups.

This is done to ensure the privacy of users.\nWhatsApp is also adding a username system (@username); relying solely on a phone number to identify a user can be cumbersome or even impossible in some contexts. Thus, WhatsApp now assigns a LID to each user on its platform.\nThis LID is unique to each user, similar to a JID (phone number–based).

It automatically chunks the contact list. NOWEB: Splits the contact list into chunks of 5,000 contacts and sends status messages sequentially. When sending image, voice, or video status messages, NOWEB re-uploads the media for each chunk. GOWS: Also splits the contact list into chunks of 5,000 contacts, sending them sequentially. For image, voice, or video status messages, GOWS reuses the uploaded media for each chunk (no re-uploads). Both NOWEB and GOWS use the same message.id for each chunk, allowing you to track \u0026ldquo;views\u0026rdquo; for status messages just like regular messages.\nYou might encounter errors when sending status messages to 10K contacts.\nIf that happens, or if you\u0026rsquo;d like more control over the process, you can use the following manual flow to send the status message to your contacts in smaller chunks.\n1. Generate a New Message ID First, generate a new message ID. You’ll use this ID for all status messages in this batch.\nGET /api/{SESSION}/status/new-message-id\rResponse\r{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u0026#34; }\r2. Get Your Own ID To view your own status message on your device, retrieve your user ID:\nGET /api/{SESSION}/me\rResponse\r{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;11111111111@c.us\u0026#34;, ... }\r3. Get Your Contacts List You can either use your existing contact list from a CRM or database, or fetch all contacts from WhatsApp:\nGET /api/contacts/all?session={NAME}\rResponse\r[ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;88888888888@c.us\u0026#34;, ... }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;99999999999@c.us\u0026#34;, ... } ]\r4. Send the Status Message to Contacts Once you have your Message ID, your own ID, and the contacts list, you can start sending status messages in chunks.\nWe recommend using smaller chunks (256–512 contacts) to make retries and error handling easier.\nIf you set contacts: null, the system uses the default chunk size of 5,000 contacts, which works well for most cases.\nAlways use the same Message ID for all chunks. This allows you to track views consistently across all recipients. Include your own ID in the first chunk, so you can immediately view the status and receive the message.ack event. POST /api/{session}/status/text\rBody\r{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AAAAAAAAA\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;contacts\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;11111111111@c.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;88888888888@c.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;...\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Check this out!\u0026#34; }\rContinue sending the status message to the next chunk until you’ve sent it to all contacts.\nIf you encounter any errors, you can retry sending the message to the same chunk.\n","date":"2020-10-06","id":20,"permalink":"/docs/how-to/status/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYou can send statuses (aka stories) using HTTP API!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;\"\u003e\n\r\n\u003cimg\r\n  srcset=\"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrIAAABXRUJQVlA4IKYAAADQBACdASoVABUAP1mIu1EpJCKhMBgIASYrCewAxogTsAvR7Eufsv0Xd9CodUCqAADMfrR7QOjVMiNY4KnrfH6/IR76oSFKZjv781sCtdly0pbZxRVYkFEm\u0026#43;7DNpRXkswRMNpdAnIKl//S1zbyrwNvqIS6xsvPQpLRe7Bs0Hs05f6EQpaVhso9YH9JR68yC29keosAywfMyDsM3IubKlstwe8SpPgAA\"\r\n      data-srcset=\"/docs/how-to/status/status_hu_582436ac2cd8bfda.webp 480w,/docs/how-to/status/status_hu_3400e3fee1303e03.webp 576w,/docs/how-to/status/status_hu_b9579f05c3c6460f.webp 768w,/docs/how-to/status/status_hu_b5f023fc494e0970.webp 1024w\"\r\n      data-sizes=\"auto\"\r\n  src=\"/docs/how-to/status/status_hu_11eb2e6f26205294.jpg\"\r\n  width=\"1024\"\r\n  height=\"1026\"\r\n  decoding=\"async\"\r\n  fetchpriority=\"auto\"\r\n  loading=\"lazy\"\r\n  alt=\"WhatsApp Status\"\r\n  class=\"lazyload blur-up\"\r\n\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"features\"\u003eFeatures\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026rsquo;s the list of features that are available by \u003ca href=\"/docs/how-to/engines/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e🏭 Engines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"🟢 Status"},{"content":"Manage WhatsApp groups with the API.\nFeatures Here\u0026rsquo;s the list of features that are available by 🏭 Engines:\n👥 Groups - API\rAPI WEBJS NOWEB GOWS POST /api/{session}/groups ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups/count ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups/join-info ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ POST /api/{session}/groups/join ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups/{id} ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ DELETE /api/{session}/groups/{id} ✔️ POST /api/{session}/groups/{id}/leave ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups/{id}/picture ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ PUT /api/{session}/groups/{id}/picture ➕ ➕ ➕ DELETE /api/{session}/groups/{id}/picture ➕ ➕ ➕ PUT /api/{session}/groups/{id}/description ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ PUT /api/{session}/groups/{id}/subject ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups/{id}/invite-code ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ POST /api/{session}/groups/{id}/invite-code/revoke ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups/{id}/settings/security/info-admin-only ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ PUT /api/{session}/groups/{id}/settings/security/info-admin-only ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups/{id}/settings/security/messages-admin-only ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ PUT /api/{session}/groups/{id}/settings/security/messages-admin-only ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ GET /api/{session}/groups/{id}/participants ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ POST /api/{session}/groups/{id}/participants/add ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ POST /api/{session}/groups/{id}/participants/remove ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ POST /api/{session}/groups/{id}/admin/promote ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ POST /api/{session}/groups/{id}/admin/demote ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ➕ - Available in ➕ WAHA Plus 👥 Groups - Events\rEvents WEBJS NOWEB GOWS group.v2.join ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ group.v2.leave ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ group.v2.participants ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ group.v2.update ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ group.join ✔️ ✔️ group.leave ✔️ API {session} - use the session name for Whatsapp instance that you created with POST /api/session endpoint {groupId} - group id in format 123123123123@g.us.

The default value is 3000. PORT=3000 is also supported (for Heroku compatibility) WHATSAPP_API_HOSTNAME=localhost: The hostname for the HTTP server. The default value is localhost. WHATSAPP_API_SCHEMA=https - it just changes media.url schema when you receive media (with files) messages. WAHA_BASE_URL - will be used to construct the media.url field in the webhook events. By default, it\u0026rsquo;s {WHATSAPP_API_SCHEMA}://{WHATSAPP_API_HOSTNAME}:{WHATSAPP_API_PORT}. WAHA_PUBLIC_URL=https://w.example.com — the publicly available link to the dashboard (use this if WAHA_BASE_URL is set to an internal address for Docker).

WAHA_DEBUG_MODE=false - enables some API only for development or troubleshooting purposes. Disabled by default. Read more on 🔍 Observability page. Logging Read more about 🔍 Observability\nOptions you can use to control how WAHA outputs logs:\nWAHA_LOG_FORMAT - supports formats: WAHA_LOG_FORMAT=PRETTY - good for local development, default format WAHA_LOG_FORMAT=JSON - can be useful if you\u0026rsquo;re using a central logging management system WAHA_LOG_LEVEL - how much information to log error | warn | info | debug | trace. 👉 Do not set debug and trace in production, as these levels generate excessive log output. WAHA_HTTP_LOG_LEVEL=info - controls the level of request completed log (HTTP access). You can set it to error | warn | info | debug | trace. DEBUG=1 - you can set this environment variable as a shortcut for WAHA_LOG_LEVEL=debug, DEBUG=1 overrides the WAHA_LOG_LEVEL to debug if both defined. 👉 Learn more about logging configuration on 🔍 Observability page. Engines Read more about 🏭 Engines\nWHATSAPP_DEFAULT_ENGINE=WEBJS - set the default engine for all sessions. Available options: WEBJS, NOWEB, GOWS. By default, it\u0026rsquo;s WEBJS. WEBJS You can use the following environment variables to configure the global behavior of the WEBJS engine:\nWAHA_WEBJS_PUPPETER_ARGS=--single-process - Add custom puppeter arguments so you can test it affects without waiting a new release (use it with cation) GOWS GODEBUG=netdns=cgo - by default, GOWS uses libc DNS resolver, but if you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing DNS issues, try to switch to the Go resolver by setting this environment variable - GODEBUG=netdns=go. docker-compose.yaml\rservices: waha: env: - GODEBUG=netdns=go dns: - 8.8.8.8 - 1.1.1.1\rSessions Read more about 🖥️ Sessions and 🗄️ Storages\nWAHA_AUTO_START_DELAY_SECONDS=0 - when docker-container restarts, WAHA starts all STOPPED sessions (or all sessions if you set WAHA_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True). You can set the delay between session restarts in seconds. By default, it\u0026rsquo;s 0. WEBJS - consider setting it to 5 if you have many sessions NOWEB - it\u0026rsquo;s fine to leave to 0 or you can increase to 1 if you experience issues with starting sessions. WAHA_PRINT_QR=True - set this variable to False to disable printing QR codes to the console. By default, True. WAHA_WORKER_ID=waha1 - set the worker ID for the session. Workers restore sessions if worker got restarted. If you have multiple workers, each worker will restore its own sessions. WHATSAPP_RESTART_ALL_SESSIONS=True: Set this variable to True to start all STOPPED sessions after container restarts. By default, this variable is set to False. Rarely used:\nWAHA_WORKER_RESTART_SESSIONS=True - restart all sessions when the worker is restarted. By default, True. WHATSAPP_START_SESSION=session1,session2: This variable can be used to start sessions with the specified names right after launching the API. Separate session names with a comma. WAHA_ZIPPER=ZIPUNZIP - use zip and unzip system binaries to pack WEBJS authentication data. Disabled by default. It\u0026rsquo;s relevant if you\u0026rsquo;re using WEBJS + MongoDB. Install zip and unzip if you don\u0026rsquo;t use our official docker image and set the variable Sessions - Device Name You can customize how sessions show up under WhatsApp → Linked Devices by setting the device and browser names.\nWAHA_CLIENT_DEVICE_NAME=TEST - custom device name.

Proxy Read more about 🔌 Proxy\nGlobal proxy If you need to use a proxy, you can set the following environment variables:\nWHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER=localhost:3128: Use this variable to set the proxy server in the format host:port, without http or https. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_USERNAME=username and WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_PASSWORD=password: Use these variables to set up credentials for the proxy. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_LIST=host1.example.com:3138,host2.example.com:3138: Use this variable to set a comma-separated list of addresses to use, using a round-robin algorithm to choose the server for the session. WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_INDEX_PREFIX=proxy-: Use this variable to parse the session name for the prefix and find the appropriate session. For example, if you have set WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_LIST=host-first:80,host-second:80,host-third:80 and WHATSAPP_PROXY_SERVER_INDEX_PREFIX=proxy- and you run proxy-3 session, the host-third:80 proxy will be chosen for that session. This is a way to select a proxy from while you start session. Session proxy You can configure proxy when you start session by setting config.proxy fields.

By default, all files are downloaded. The mimetypes must be separated by a comma, without spaces. For example: audio,image/png,image/gif. To choose a specific type, use a prefix (like audio,image). See usage below. WHATSAPP_DOWNLOAD_MEDIA=true - this variable can be used to completely disable downloading media files. By default, all files are downloaded. Set this variable to WHATSAPP_DOWNLOAD_MEDIA=false to disable downloading media files. Under the hood, it sets WHATSAPP_FILES_MIMETYPES=mimetype/ignore-all-media to ignore all media files. WHATSAPP_FILES_LIFETIME: This variable can be used to set the time (in seconds) after which files will be removed to free up space. The default value is 180. Set this variable to 0 to disable the file lifetime. WHATSAPP_FILES_FOLDER: This variable can be used to set the folder where files from chats (images, voice messages) will be stored. The default value is /tmp/whatsapp-files. The folder must be mounted to the host machine to keep the files between container restarts.

The Worker then picks up this event, processes it, and forwards the message to ChatWoot via its API.

The API saves this job to the Redis queue, from which the Worker retrieves it. The Worker then requests the WAHA API to send the message to WhatsApp. After WhatsApp confirms delivery, the API acknowledges the Worker, which then marks the job as processed in Redis. kroki {type=mermaid} sequenceDiagram participant ChatWoot as ChatWoot API participant WA_API as WAHA API participant Redis as Redis participant Worker as Worker participant WA_Session as WhatsApp ChatWoot -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ChatWoot: New message created ChatWoot -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; WA_API: Call Webhook WA_API --\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ChatWoot: 200 OK WA_API -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Redis: \u0026#39;message_created\u0026#39; event Redis -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Worker: Fire Job Worker -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; WA_API: /api/sendText WA_API -\u0026gt;\u0026gt; WA_Session: Send message to WhatsApp WA_Session --\u0026gt;\u0026gt; WA_API: ACK: Server WA_API --\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Worker: 200 OK Worker --\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Redis: Mark job as processed\rYou can use the WAHA Jobs Dashboard at http://localhost:3000/jobs for monitoring Worker and it\u0026rsquo;s jobs:\nApps SDK This section is currently under development.

Your Chatwoot and WAHA settings must be kept in sync.\nSingle Conversation — one ongoing thread per WhatsApp chat; new messages append to the same conversation (reopens if resolved). Multiple Conversations — agents resolve threads; the next incoming message creates a new conversation, allowing several per contact. Single Conversation One conversation per WhatsApp chat (WhatsApp-like behavior). Each message goes to a single conversation. Every contact in Chatwoot has only one open (or resolved) conversation, and incoming WhatsApp messages are added to that conversation (and reopen it if it’s closed).\nSet in Chatwoot:\nInbox - Lock to single conversation - Enabled Set in WAHA:\nSelect conversation behavior - Created: Newest Use Conversation with Status - Use Any Status Multiple Conversations Multiple conversations per WhatsApp chat (Chatwoot’s philosophy).\nA conversation remains active until an agent resolves it. After resolution, a new incoming message creates a new conversation.\nSet in Chatwoot:\nInbox - Lock to single conversation - Disabled Set in WAHA:\nSelect conversation behavior - Activity: Newest Use Conversation with Status - Use Only: Open, Pending, Snoozed Activity Includes Conversation Status Changes\nIf you set Select conversation behavior to Activity: Newest, Chatwoot treats conversation status changes as activity.\nLanguage You can adjust messages, templates, and branding in the content WAHA sends to Chatwoot and WhatsApp by providing key-value overrides in YAML.\nWhat Templates Can I Override?\nYou can find all languages and keys in the source code /src/apps/chatwoot/i18n/locales\nPer-app Language Overrides The easiest way to test or apply a few template overrides is to use the 📊 Dashboard, then set Language Overrides:\nCopy a template from Language Templates, or create your own template. Save the app. Test your changes. Global Language Overrides If you want to apply the overrides to all apps or add a new language, you can do this globally.\nIn the steps below, we assume you installed WAHA using the 🔧 Install \u0026amp; Update guide.\nCreate the chatwoot-languages directory and download the language file you want to modify (or use as a template for a new language): Download Language\rmkdir chatwoot-languages cd chatwoot-languages wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlikeapro/waha/refs/heads/core/src/apps/chatwoot/i18n/locales/en-US.yaml\rDecide what you want to do: To add a new language — rename the file To make only a few changes to the default — keep the file name Rename File (only if adding a new language)\rmv en-US.yaml company.yaml\rEdit the file: If you are adding a new language, set a distinct locale.name and provide ALL keys If you are overriding the default, change only the desired keys and remove the rest Change Templates\rvim en-US.yaml\rUpdate docker-compose.yaml to mount the folder with language overrides docker-compose.yaml\rservices: waha: restart: always image: devlikeapro/waha-plus volumes: - \u0026#39;./sessions:/app/.sessions\u0026#39;

Kindly don\u0026rsquo;t use it in chatId when sending messages 12312312123133@g.us - Groups uses random number with @g.us at the end. 123123123@lid - is a hidden user ID, each user has a regular ID along with a hidden one. WhatsApp added that type of ID along with communities functionality. 123123123@newsletter - for 📰 WhatsApp Channels. Store under the hood Under the hood, the NOWEB stores the session data in database based on 🗄️ Storage you choose - either in files or in MongoDB.\nFor File local storage it creates sqlite3 database at .sessions/noweb/{sessionName}/store.sqlite3 store with chats, contacts, messages tables with proper indexes. 👉 We don\u0026rsquo;t recommend opening it manually when the session is running, even for reading, it can lead to the loss of the chat history. For MongoDB in waha_{engine}_{sessionName} it creates chats, contacts, messages collections with proper indexes. 👉 You can safely READ from the database, but DO NOT WRITE to it manually, it can lead to the loss of the chat history.

Any S3 Compatible storage can be used, such as AWS S3, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, etc. For in-house solutions, you can use MinIO. You can find complete docker-compose.yaml with all storages and other configurations and use it as the starting point for your project.\nSessions Storage 🖥️ Session Storage is used to store session data, such as authentication information, configuration, and other data that is required to keep the session alive and connected to WhatsApp.\nIf you want to save your session and avoid scanning the QR code every time you launch WAHA, you MUST connect the session storage to the container.\nFor the session storage, you can use the following options:\nLocal - the default option, stores the session data in the local storage using files. PostgreSQL - stores the session data in the PostgreSQL database. MongoDB - stores the session data in the MongoDB database. You can find complete docker-compose.yaml with all storages and other configurations and use it as the starting point for your project.\nSessions - Local By default, the WAHA uses the local storage (files) to store the session data.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a well-tested solution even for production with multiple sessions\nQuick Start To use local storage with session persistence, you need to mount a volume to the /app/.sessions directory. Here are the common ways to do this:\nUsing Docker Run (recommended for development): docker run -v `pwd`/.sessions:/app/.sessions -p 3000:3000 devlikeapro/waha-plus\rUsing Docker Compose (recommended for production): services: waha: image: devlikeapro/waha-plus volumes: - ./.sessions:/app/.sessions ports: - \u0026#34;127.0.0.1:3000:3000\u0026#34;\rUsing Custom Directory (if you need a specific location): docker run -v /custom/path/to/sessions:/app/.sessions -p 3000:3000 devlikeapro/waha-plus\rConfiguration Options WAHA_LOCAL_STORE_BASE_DIR=/app/.sessions - Override the base directory for local storage Useful for handling Azure \u0026ldquo;dot\u0026rdquo; restrictions #597 Default: /app/.sessions Directory Structure The session data is organized in the following structure:\nsessions/ ├── webjs/ # Engine-specific directory │ ├── default/ # Session directory │ │ └── ... # Session files │ └── another-session/ # Another session │ └── ... # Session files │ └── noweb/ # Another engine └── default/ └── ...\rHealth Check ➕ WAHA Plus provides health check endpoints.\nSessions - PostgreSQL If you want to use the PostgreSQL to store the session data, you need to set WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_POSTGRESQL_URL environment variable\nUsing Docker Run\ndocker run \\ -e WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ devlikeapro/waha-plus\rUsing Docker Compose\ndocker-compose.yaml\rservices: waha: image: devlikeapro/waha-plus ports: - \u0026#34;127.0.0.1:3000:3000\u0026#34; environment: - WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable depends_on: - postgres postgres: image: postgres:17 environment: - POSTGRES_USER=postgres - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres - POSTGRES_DB=postgres volumes: - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data command: - postgres - \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;max_connections=3000\u0026#34; volumes: postgres_data:\r❓ I want to run \u0026gt;100 sessions on PostgreSQL | pg sorry, too many clients already\rIf you see the error:\npg sorry, too many clients already\nMake sure to increase the max_connections in the postgresql.conf file or start it with the flag:\npostgres -c max_connections=3000\rWAHA uses Multiple Databases schema\n👉 Read how WAHA uses databases in the Database Schema section.\nSessions - MongoDB Deprecated\nMongoDB storage is deprecated and no new features will be added to it.\n👉 Use PostgresSQL instead for new installations.\nIf you want to use the MongoDB to store the session data, you need to:\nStart the MongoDB server (using docker or any other way). You can either start your own MongoDB server or use the one of cloud providers, like MongoDB Atlas. Set WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_MONGO_URL=mongodb://user:password@host:port/ environment variable to connect to the MongoDB server. We recommend using your own MongoDB server as close as possible to the WAHA server for the best performance and security reasons.\nWAHA uses Multiple Databases schema\n👉 Read how WAHA uses databases in the Database Schema section.\nFirst, you need to start MongoDB server:\ndocker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo\rThen, you need to run the WAHA with the WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_MONGO_URL environment variable (please note using --network host option as well)\ndocker run -e WHATSAPP_SESSIONS_MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/ --network host devlikeapro/waha-plus\rThat\u0026rsquo;s all you need to do to use MongoDB storage. All session authentication data will be automatically stored in the MongoDB database.\nFor managing and troubleshooting MongoDB, we recommend using MongoDB Compass.\nHealth Check ➕ WAHA Plus provides health check endpoints.\nMedia Storage When your WhatsApp instance receives media files, it stores them in the 🖼️ Media Storage.\nYou can use the following options to store the media files:\nLocal - stores the media files in the local storage using files. PostgreSQL - stores the media files in the PostgreSQL database. S3 - stores the media files in the S3 storage.

Download and start image First of all, you must run WhatsApp API locally (which under the hood it runs real WhatsApp Web instance and expose HTTP API for interaction).\nHere are the steps from Quick Start:\nDownload and start WhatsApp API docker container\n# Download the image docker pull devlikeapro/waha # Run the docker container docker run -it --rm --network=host -e WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=http://localhost:5000/bot -e \u0026#34;WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=*\u0026#34; --name waha devlikeapro/waha # It prints logs and the last line must be # WhatsApp API is running on: http://[::1]:3000\rDownload image - ARM If you\u0026rsquo;re using ARM (like Apple Silicon, Apple M1, etc.) - use following commands to download the image\nFor Core version the command is\n# Download the image docker pull devlikeapro/waha:arm # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha:arm devlikeapro/waha # Run the docker container docker run -it

out and Execute it with default session name Find GET /api/screenshot and execute it - it must show QR code Scan QR code on your mobile WhatsApp application (that installed on your phone) Execute GET /api/screenshot once again - it must show the screenshot from WhatsApp Web. Send test text message - find POST /api/sendText and execute it with payload (change 12132132130 in the chatId to phone number that is registered in WhatsApp). { \u0026#34;chatId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12132132130@c.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hi there!\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;session\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; }\rIf you see Hi there! message then you\u0026rsquo;re ready to run bots!\nWhatsApp Echo Bot The WhatsApp Echo Bot is a sample ktor webhook server application that echoes back to you whatever you send it.

Python.\nYou can find the examples in examples folder on GitHub with detailed instructions in README.md -\u0026gt;\nInstallation We assume that you have installed software:\nPython 3 Docker Download and start image First of all, you must run WhatsApp API locally (which under the hood it runs real WhatsApp Web instance and expose HTTP API for interaction).\nHere are the steps from Quick Start:\nDownload and start WhatsApp API docker container\n# Download the image docker pull devlikeapro/waha # Run the docker container docker run -it --rm --network=host -e WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=http://localhost:5000/bot -e \u0026#34;WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=*\u0026#34; --name waha devlikeapro/waha # It prints logs and the last line must be # WhatsApp API is running on: http://[::1]:3000\rDownload image - ARM If you\u0026rsquo;re using ARM (like Apple Silicon, Apple M1, etc.) - use following commands to download the image\nFor Core version the command is\n# Download the image docker pull devlikeapro/waha:arm # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha:arm devlikeapro/waha # Run the docker container docker run -it

is running on: http://[::1]:3000\rStart session and scan QR Open Swagger API in the browser http://localhost:3000/ Start session and scan QR code in swagger Find POST /api/sessions request press Try it out and Execute it with default session name Find GET /api/screenshot and execute it - it must show QR code Scan QR code on your mobile WhatsApp application (that installed on your phone) Execute GET /api/screenshot once again - it must show the screenshot from WhatsApp Web. Send test text message - find POST /api/sendText and execute it with payload (change 12132132130 in the chatId to phone number that is registered in WhatsApp). { \u0026#34;chatId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12132132130@c.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hi there!\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;session\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; }\rIf you see Hi there! message then you\u0026rsquo;re ready to run bots!\nWhatsApp Echo Bot The WhatsApp Echo Bot is a sample flask webhook server application that echoes back to you whatever you send it.

You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about language-specific libraries or chrome installation.\nAlso, Docker makes installation and update processes so simple, just one command!\nWhy Docker Compose?\rDocker Compose is a tool for defining and running Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application\u0026rsquo;s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. Requirements\nClean Ubuntu or any Linux-based OS Minimum 2 CPU and 2 GB RAM Public IP address assigned to the server No DNS required up front because EasyPanel provides built-in DNS. If you want to host more sessions - please check the numbers in FAQ.\nLinux\r👉 We suggest using Debian or Ubuntu based distributions. Windows\r👉 For Windows we kindly suggest using Hyper-V backend for Docker Desktop!\nIt might not work with WSL2 backend properly.\nMacOS\r👉 For MacOS use Docker Desktop!\n👉 If you use Apple M1/M2/etc - go to Docker Image Configurator and choose CPU - ARM to get the right image to use.\nLooking for Hosting?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been using the.hosting for quite a while and had a great experience.\nThey offer a wide range of server configurations and locations - highly recommended! 👍\nInstall Docker Install Docker and Docker Compose on your VM # example in ubuntu apt-get update apt-get upgrade curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh sudo sh get-docker.sh apt install docker-compose-plugin\rPull Image Pull image for your case:\nWAHA Core ➕ WAHA Plus WAHA (ARM) Run the command below:\ndocker pull devlikeapro/waha\rIf you got the ➕ WAHA Plus , use the following commands:\ndocker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY} docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus docker logout\r👉 Go to Docker Image Configurator to generate the command with the right version.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using ARM (like Apple M1/M2, Raspberry Pi etc.) - use following commands to download the image:\n# Download the image docker pull devlikeapro/waha:arm # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha:arm devlikeapro/waha\rIf you got the ➕ WAHA Plus , use the following commands:\ndocker login -u devlikeapro -p {KEY} docker pull devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm docker logout # Rename it, so you can use devlikeapro/waha image in other place docker tag devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm devlikeapro/waha-plus\r👉 Go to Docker Image Configurator to generate the command with the right version.\nWAHA Download the required files # Download the Docker compose template wget -O docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devlikeapro/waha/refs/heads/core/docker-compose.yaml # Create empty .env file touch .env\rPick the image in docker-compose.yaml before running init-waha: WAHA Core ➕ WAHA Plus WAHA (ARM) If you don\u0026rsquo;t have ➕ WAHA Plus, make sure you have this image in docker-compose.yaml:\ndocker-compose.yaml\rservices: waha: restart: always image: devlikeapro/waha\rIf you have ➕ WAHA Plus, make sure you have this image in docker-compose.yaml:\ndocker-compose.yaml\rservices: waha: restart: always image: devlikeapro/waha-plus\rIf you\u0026rsquo;re using ARM (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi, etc.), make sure you have this image in docker-compose.yaml:\ndocker-compose.yaml\rservices: waha: restart: always image: devlikeapro/waha:arm\rIf you have ➕ WAHA Plus on ARM, use:\ndocker-compose.yaml\rservices: waha: restart: always image: devlikeapro/waha-plus:arm\rGenerate a .env file that we\u0026rsquo;ll use in the next step for credentials: Init WAHA\rdocker compose run --no-deps -v \u0026#34;$(pwd)\u0026#34;:/app/env waha init-waha /app/env\rInit WAHA (Output)\rCredentials generated.

Please note that the containers are not exposed to the internet, and they only bind to the localhost. Set up something like Nginx or any other proxy server to proxy the requests to the container. How to export port from remote server?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using a remote server (like VPS or Virtual Machine on your laptop) you need to allow access for your browser. Use one of the options available.\nSSH tunneling If you\u0026rsquo;re connecting to ssh, you can forward port 3000 on your laptop like\nssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 user@you.address.here\rBind port to all ips For temporary external access, you can change the port binding from 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 to 3000:3000 in the docker-compose.yaml file.\ndocker-compose.yaml\rservices: waha: image: devlikeapro/waha-plus ports: - \u0026#34;3000:3000\u0026#34;\rdocker compose up -d\rThis makes your instance accessible at http://\u0026lt;your-external-ip\u0026gt;:3000.\nNow, open http://localhost:3000/dashboard and log in with the credentials you have in .env file: Dashboard - WAHA_DASHBOARD_USERNAME / WAHA_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD Swagger: WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_USERNAME / WHATSAPP_SWAGGER_PASSWORD Api Key: WAHA_API_KEY Nginx 👉 Replace \u0026lt;YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_IP\u0026gt; with your domain name in the following steps (use lowercase).\nConfigure Nginx to serve as a frontend proxy. sudo apt-get install nginx cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled nano \u0026lt;YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_IP\u0026gt;.conf\rUse the following Nginx config and replace the \u0026lt;YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_IP\u0026gt; in server_name. server { server_name \u0026lt;YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_IP\u0026gt;; # Point upstream to WAHA Server set $upstream 127.0.0.1:3000; location /.well-known { alias /var/www/ssl-proof/waha/.well-known; } location / { proxy_pass_header Authorization; proxy_pass http://$upstream; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \u0026#34;Upgrade\u0026#34;; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on; # Optional proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_buffering off; client_max_body_size 0; proxy_read_timeout 36000s; proxy_redirect off; } listen 80; }\rVerify and reload your Nginx config by running the following command. nginx -t systemctl reload nginx\rHere are two scenarios for setting up HTTPS:\nHTTPS - Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt If you have a domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com) that points to your server\u0026rsquo;s IP address, you can use Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt to get free, trusted SSL certificates:\nRun Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt to configure SSL certificate.

WAHA adds the wa/messages commands so you can import older history. Use them to copy past chats, check imports, or fix sync issues without leaving the integration inbox.\nChatWoot Rate Limit Configuration\nBy default, ChatWoot set API and new message rate limits that are too low for history imports.\nSet these variables in your ChatWoot deployment (for example in .env, Docker Compose, or Helm values) so WAHA can send many messages without hitting rate limits:\n.chatwoot.env\rCONVERSATION_MESSAGE_PER_MINUTE_LIMIT=3000 RACK_ATTACK_LIMIT=30000 # OR RACK_ATTACK_ALLOWED_IPS={your.waha.ip.address1}\r👉 Without them, large history pulls often return ChatWoot API rate-limit errors (check FAQ section for details).\nMessages Actions Three actions are available:\nwa/messages help prints the full list of options. wa/messages status reports the progress of the active or last finished pull job. wa/messages pull starts a new history import. You can use \u0026lsquo;wa/\u0026rsquo; prefix to execute commands in any chats\nYou can run commands into 2 ways, depending on the conversation you\u0026rsquo;re in:\nWhatsApp Integration chat - use command or wa/command. Any other conversation in the Inbox - use wa/command only. # In WhatsApp Integration chat - use either with or without help wa/help # In Any conversation for the Inbox - use wa/ prefix wa/help 👉 We use the wa/ prefix in the guides, but you can omit it in the WhatsApp Integration chat:\n⚙️ Override the prefix by setting the WAHA_CHATWOOT_COMMAND_PREFIX=wa/ environment variable.\nPull WhatsApp Messages Run in the WhatsApp Integration conversation or Customer Conversation to copy messages from WhatsApp into your ChatWoot inbox.\nCommand Help\rwa/messages help\rStart Pull\rwa/messages pull\rEach pull reads from WhatsApp and stores the messages in ChatWoot. You control how far back WAHA looks by adding optional duration arguments. The logic for message pull depends on conversation in ChatWoot:\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s WhatsApp Integration conversation, WAHA pulls messages for all contacts in the selected inbox. If it\u0026rsquo;s a Customer Conversation, WAHA pulls messages only for the contact linked to that You can start playing with Customer Conversations to backfill history for specific users without affecting others.\nPull 1 Day With Media\rwa/messages pull 1d --force --media\rUse wa/messages status to check that the pull is running, review counters, and read any warnings returned by WhatsApp.\nDuration Explained Duration Syntax\rwa/messages pull [start] [end]\rThe commands accept simple relative values such as 1d, 12h, or 30m.\nWAHA sorts the two numbers so the earliest value becomes the start of the window and the latest value becomes the end.\nwa/messages pull (or wa/messages pull 1d 0d) uses the default 1d | 0d window. In the example above, we ran the command on 31 Oct at 14:00, so WAHA pulled everything from 30 Oct 14:00 up to the command time. Default Window\rwa/messages pull # The same as wa/messages pull 1d # The same as wa/messages pull 1d 0d\rwa/messages pull 10d 0d collects the last 10 days while keeping the end at “now”. Ten Day Window\rwa/messages pull 10d # The same as wa/messages pull 10d 0d\rwa/messages pull 20d 10d covers the range between 20 and 10 days ago, so you can restore older history in batches. Batch Pull Sequence\r# # Send below commands ONE BY ONE # wa/messages pull 30d 20d wa/messages pull 20d 10d wa/messages pull 10d 0d # You can omit the last 0d # The same as wa/messages pull 30d # The same as wa/messages pull 30d 0d\rYou can mix units (7d, 6h, 15m) and WAHA converts them to milliseconds automatically.\n⚠️ 6m means 6 minutes, not 6 months. Use 180d for approximately 6 months.\nUse Canned Responses You can create Canned Responses in ChatWoot with shortcuts for common WAHA commands.\nIn ChatWoot go to Settings → Canned Responses. Click Create canned response and set a memorable shortcut like wa-contacts-pull. Add the command in the body, for example wa/contacts pull --avatar if-missing. Start typing /wa in the conversation to see the list of available shortcuts. Examples Pull the last 24 hours Keep the defaults to backfill the recent timeline:\nDefault Pull\rwa/messages pull\rif you want to rebuild the whole 1-day conversation in the chat you can do:\nForce 1 Day\rwa/messages pull 1d --force\ror include media files as well\nForce 1 Day With Media\rwa/messages pull 1d --force --media\rRebuild the last 10 days Grab a broader range while still ending at the current moment:\nTen Day Pull\rwa/messages pull 10d # --force\rInclude Media By default, WAHA only pulls text messages to speed up the process.\nYou can include media attachments with --media flag:\nInclude Media\rwa/messages pull --media\rPull Other Chats By default, WAHA only pulls messages from direct chats (1:1).\nYou can include groups, channels, status replies, and broadcast lists with these flags:\nInclude Other Chats\rwa/messages pull --groups --channels --status --broadcast\rYou can also exclude direct messages with --no-dm flag:\nGroups Only\rwa/messages pull --no-dm --groups\rResolve conversations after import Close conversations once their history is restored so agents can focus on new tickets:\nAuto Resolve\rwa/messages pull --resolve-conversations\r--rc is a shorthand for the same option.\nImport an older in batch Backfill past interactions without rewriting newer chats:\nSegmented Pull Sequence\r# # Send below commands ONE BY ONE # wa/messages pull 30d 20d wa/messages pull 20d 10d wa/messages pull 10d 0d\rPause new messages while pulling history When you import big history chunks, and a new message arrives, WAHA creates it immediately in ChatWoot, so you can end up with mixed old and new messages in the same conversation.\nFor import big history case (especially for the first new inbox import), you can stop the queues before starting the pull and restart them after it finishes.\nQueue Pause Affects All Sessions\nPausing the queues affects ALL WhatsApp sessions connected to the same WAHA worker instance and ChatWoot inbox (to be precise, all WAHA connected to the same Redis) If messages pull ... --pause fails, you must manually restart the queues with wa/queue start. You can check the current status with wa/queue status. Manual Pause Example\r# # Send below commands ONE BY ONE # wa/queue stop wa/queue status wa/messages pull 1y --rc wa/queue start wa/queue status\rThe same pause can be automated in one step with:\nAuto Pause\rwa/messages pull 1y --rc --pause\r--pause adds the pull to the queue in a paused state and resumes the queues automatically after it completes.\nFull options Adjust the values to fit your environment and run wa/messages help to see current defaults from your build.\nwa/messages help\rFull Options\rwa/messages pull --chat all --force --no-dm --groups --channels --status --broadcast --media --pause --resolve-conversations --batch 100 --progress 100 --attempts 6 --timeout 10m --timeout-media 30s\rFAQ ❓ Question: I\u0026rsquo;m getting \u0026ldquo;Too many messages\u0026rdquo; in the ChatWoot API response when pulling history\n💬 Answer: Increase CONVERSATION_MESSAGE_PER_MINUTE_LIMIT to at least 3000 (or higher for very large imports) so ChatWoot accepts the many messages WAHA sends during a pull.\n❓ Question: I\u0026rsquo;m getting \u0026ldquo;HTTP 429 Too Many Requests\u0026rdquo; from the ChatWoot API\n💬 Answer: Raise RACK_ATTACK_LIMIT to 30000 or add your WAHA servers to RACK_ATTACK_ALLOWED_IPS={your.waha.ip.address1},{your.waha.ip.address2} to let the import traffic bypass rate limiting.\n","date":"2025-10-30","id":70,"permalink":"/blog/apps-chatwoot-messages/","summary":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"callout callout-caution d-flex flex-row mt-4 mb-4 pt-4 pe-4 pb-2 ps-3\"\u003e\r\n  \u003csvg\n  xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  width=\"24\"\n  height=\"24\"\n  viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n  fill=\"none\"\n  stroke=\"currentColor\"\n  stroke-width=\"2\"\n  stroke-linecap=\"round\"\n  stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n \n class=\"outline/gavel svg-inline callout-icon me-2 mb-3\" id=\"svg-gavel\" role=\"img\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M13 10l7.383 7.418c.823 .82 .823 2.148 0 2.967a2.11 2.11 0 0 1 -2.976 0l-7.407 -7.385\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M6 9l4 4\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M13 10l-4 -4\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M3 21h7\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M6.793 15.793l-3.586 -3.586a1 1 0 0 1 0 -1.414l2.293 -2.293l.5 .5l3 -3l-.5 -.5l2.293 -2.293a1 1 0 0 1 1.414 0l3.586 3.586a1 1 0 0 1 0 1.414l-2.293 2.293l-.5 -.5l-3 3l.5 .5l-2.293 2.293a1 1 0 0 1 -1.414 0z\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\r\n  \u003cdiv class=\"callout-content\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"callout-title\"\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003eDisclaimer\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"WhatsApp + ChatWoot - Messages"},{"content":" Disclaimer\nThis project is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with WhatsApp, ChatWoot, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

It copies your WhatsApp contact list into a chosen ChatWoot inbox so agents see fresh names, avatars, and identifiers.\nIt only reads from WhatsApp, so nothing changes on the phone and it pulls contacts rather than syncing them. Each run updates existing profiles in ChatWoot and adds contacts you have not imported yet. Open the WhatsApp Integration conversation inside ChatWoot (the same thread you use for other WAHA commands).\nwa/contacts help\rThen run a simple contacts pull like this:\nwa/contacts pull\rChatWoot replies that the job is queued and processes the contact list in the background.\nOne pull per WAHA session\nRun a new wa/contacts pull only after the previous job for the same WAHA session has finished. Other sessions can sync their own contacts at the same time, but overlapping pulls within one session cancel each other out.\nCheck the current status with wa/contacts status.\n👇 Check Examples below for common use cases and advanced options.\nUse Canned Responses You can create Canned Responses in ChatWoot with shortcuts for common WAHA commands.\nIn ChatWoot go to Settings → Canned Responses. Click Create canned response and set a memorable shortcut like wa-contacts-pull. Add the command in the body, for example wa/contacts pull --avatar if-missing. Start typing /wa in the conversation to see the list of available shortcuts. Examples Refresh contact basics Keep the defaults and let WAHA import everyone with missing profiles:\nwa/contacts pull\rUpdate avatar Ideal when you want the profile photos in ChatWoot:\nwa/contacts pull --avatar\rBy default, it uses the --avatar if-missing option, so it only pulls avatars for contacts without photos in ChatWoot.\nYou can update avatars for all contacts by specifying the --avatar update flag:\nwa/contacts pull --avatar update\rKeep an eye on avatars\nRefreshing avatars can trigger some backoff mechanisms on the WhatsApp side, especially if you have many contacts with profile photos.\nThe --avatar if-missing setting is the safest option to avoid issues.\nInclude groups and hidden numbers Bring in WhatsApp groups and LID contacts (users who hide their phone number) in the same run:\nwa/contacts pull --groups --lids --avatar\rFull options This command shows every available flag, but use wa/contacts help to explore all latest options.\nAdjust the numbers to match your environment:\nwa/contacts pull --avatar if-missing --groups --lids --no-attributes --batch 50 --progress 50 --delay-contact 250ms --delay-batch 2s --attempts 8 --timeout 15m\r","date":"2025-10-29","id":71,"permalink":"/blog/apps-chatwoot-contacts/","summary":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"callout callout-caution d-flex flex-row mt-4 mb-4 pt-4 pe-4 pb-2 ps-3\"\u003e\r\n  \u003csvg\n  xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n  width=\"24\"\n  height=\"24\"\n  viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n  fill=\"none\"\n  stroke=\"currentColor\"\n  stroke-width=\"2\"\n  stroke-linecap=\"round\"\n  stroke-linejoin=\"round\"\n \n class=\"outline/gavel svg-inline callout-icon me-2 mb-3\" id=\"svg-gavel\" role=\"img\"\u003e\n  \u003cpath stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M13 10l7.383 7.418c.823 .82 .823 2.148 0 2.967a2.11 2.11 0 0 1 -2.976 0l-7.407 -7.385\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M6 9l4 4\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M13 10l-4 -4\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M3 21h7\" /\u003e\n  \u003cpath d=\"M6.793 15.793l-3.586 -3.586a1 1 0 0 1 0 -1.414l2.293 -2.293l.5 .5l3 -3l-.5 -.5l2.293 -2.293a1 1 0 0 1 1.414 0l3.586 3.586a1 1 0 0 1 0 1.414l-2.293 2.293l-.5 -.5l-3 3l.5 .5l-2.293 2.293a1 1 0 0 1 -1.414 0z\" /\u003e\n\u003c/svg\u003e\r\n  \u003cdiv class=\"callout-content\"\u003e\r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"callout-title\"\u003e\r\n        \u003cp\u003eDisclaimer\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"WhatsApp + ChatWoot - Contacts"},{"content":"🧩 ChatWoot 1.1 ChatWoot integration graduates to v1.1, adding conversation control, CSAT surveys, richer language templates, and safer contact handling.\nHow to: 🧩 ChatWoot App Highlights: conversation pause/resume, CSAT, share contact/location, broadcast reception, better Brazilian numbers. 🏭 NOWEB 7.0-rc NOWEB climbs to the 7.0-rc engine with fresh builds, proto updates, phone-login fixes, and poll stability improvements.\nDocs: 🏭 NOWEB Engine: 7.0.0 with latest proto v1027393660 and October 3 engine refresh. 🖥️ Sessions - Filter Chats Dial in signal by filtering broadcasts directly in session config.

Some WAHA users deployed the API and made it accessible over the internet — but forgot to secure it. No API keys. No reverse proxies. Just a raw, open API ready-to-take commands from anyone who knew the endpoint.\nIt didn’t take long for bots and malicious actors to find those ports. Once they did — they used sessions, hijacked WhatsApp accounts, sent spam messages.\n⚠️ This IS NOT just a theoretical risk. We had multiple cases this month alone. If your API is open, you are exposed.\n👥 Who Is Affected? This vulnerability affects anyone who is running WAHA or WAHA Plus and:\nExposes the /api port directly to the internet, Has no API key set in the .env or Docker environment, Don’t use HTTPS or any firewall/reverse proxy to restrict access. This includes Docker deployments, VPS installs, even cloud setups that skip security steps.\n🛠️ How to Fix It Do not expose WhatsApp API on public networks!\nUse at least 64 symbols random string as WHATSAPP_API_KEY string that contains letters (a-z, A-Z) and numbers (1-9) Read more 🔒 Security Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can immediately protect your setup:\nUse API Key Authentication WAHA requires an api_key for all endpoints. Make sure you set and enforce it in your environment: WHATSAPP_API_KEY=your_strong_key_here\rDon’t expose your API directly to the internet! Keep it behind:\nA VPN A reverse proxy with authentication A firewall that limits access to trusted IPs Enable HTTPS Use Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt or self-signed certificates to ensure traffic is encrypted.\n❓ FAQ 🔒 Changing ports will not save you! Obscuring your API behind a “random” port like 39823? Doesn’t matter. Bots scan all ports. If it’s open and unprotected — they’ll find it.\n🧱 I don\u0026rsquo;t have WAHA Plus, how can I still be secure? You still have options:\nDo not expose the API port to the internet Only bind the container to localhost or your internal network.\nUse third-party software to protect your API Tools like Ngrok can tunnel securely, and you can wrap requests with basic auth or tokens.\nUse a firewall to restrict access Restrict incoming traffic to your trusted IPs only. Tools like ufw or iptables can help with that.\n🚨 Final Word Leaving your API exposed is like leaving your house door wide open with a sign saying “not using locks.” WAHA gives you the tools to be secure. Use them.\nStay safe 🛡️\n","date":"2025-04-29","id":83,"permalink":"/blog/security-alert/","summary":"\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"-waha-security-alert\"\u003e🚨 WAHA Security Alert\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve recently seen a disturbing trend: users running WAHA with the \u003cstrong\u003eAPI publicly exposed\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ewithout any form of protection\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"🚨 WAHA Security Alert"},{"content":" We’re excited to introduce WAHA 2025.4, packed with new API capabilities, group handling improvements, and crucial bug fixes across all engines!\n🆕 What\u0026rsquo;s New? ✅ Mark Messages as Read!

How many sessions can you run by adding more resources (CPU and RAM) to a single WAHA server?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an approximate example of how many sessions you can run on a single server using the Vertical Scaling approach:\n🏭 Engine Sessions CPU Memory WEBJS 10 270% 2.5GB WEBJS 50 1500% 20GB NOWEB 50 150% 4GB NOWEB 500 300% 30GB 👉 The benchmark may differ from case to case, depending on usage patterns - how many messages you receive, how many you send, etc.\nSo if you need to run up to 50 sessions on the WEBJS engine or up to 500 sessions on NOWEB - you can just keep adding more resources (CPU and RAM) to the single server! Fast to scale, easy to manage. 🎉\nIf you want to run more sessions - you need to consider Horizontal Scaling. It\u0026rsquo;s not safe to run more than the above numbers on a single server!\nHorizontal Scaling - Sharding Horizontal Scaling is the process of adding more servers to handle more sessions.\nRight now, the only way to do it is to run multiple WAHA instances and distribute the sessions between them in Your Application logic using the Sharding technique:\nClick to open full size. Here are the key points for setting up Horizontal Scaling using the Sharding technique:\nYou run multiple WAHA instances listening on different hostnames (http://waha1.example.com, http://waha2.example.com, etc.) or ports (http://waha.example.com:3001, http://waha.example.com:3002, etc.). You save the list of url, api-key, capacity to Your Application Database - Entities Schema When a new user asks to run a new session - you follow the Where to run a new session? logic to find a suitable WAHA instance and save the user \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; session \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; server association to Your Application Database. When you need to send a request to WhatsApp API - you follow the Where to find the session? logic to find the WAHA instance to send the request. All webhooks come to Your Application directly from the WAHA instance, so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about it. We\u0026rsquo;ll guide you through the process of setting up Horizontal Scaling using the Sharding technique in the next sections.\n👉 Please note that each WAHA Worker must have its own database or WAHA_WORKER_ID=waha{N} environment variable set for either File Storage or MongoDB URL (not a database).\nEntities Schema In order to save WAHA instances and session associations, you need to have the following entities in Your Application Database: Worker Worker represents a single WAHA instance that can handle sessions.\nid - unique identifier url - URL of the WAHA instance, http://waha1.example.com, http://waha2.example.com, etc. api_key - API Key to authorize requests capacity - how many sessions can be run on the WAHA instance (for simplicity, we\u0026rsquo;re using a single field, but it can be a new model AvailableSession or similar). By setting capacity, you can manage the WAHA Worker usage and prevent overloading.\nUser User is a user of Your Application that can run sessions.\nid - unique identifier 👉 You can use either User or Tenant or Organization - it completely depends on your application logic and business model. We\u0026rsquo;ll use User for simplicity with a single field:\nWAHASession WAHASession represents a single session that is running on the WAHA Worker associated with the User.\nid - unique identifier name - WAHA session name user_id - reference to the User worker_id - reference to the Worker Where to run a new session? When a new user asks to run a new session - you need to find a suitable WAHA instance to run it. You can simply get a list of sessions with capacity\u0026gt;0 and pick the one with the highest capacity. Click to open full size. This is just an example with simple logic. You can adjust it and distribute WhatsApp sessions based on country, proxy settings, customer level, etc.\nWhere to find the session? When you need to send a request to WhatsApp API - you need to find the WAHA instance to send the request. You can simply get the worker_id from the WAHASession and send the request to the WAHA instance using the url and api_key. Click to open full size. Why this way? WAHA is not a stateless application, it has a runtime state (not technically a state as in database, but still a state) - the connection to WhatsApp (either browser or websocket connection) which cannot be moved automatically, so all HTTP requests MUST be \u0026ldquo;sticky\u0026rdquo;, meaning they MUST go only to the certain \u0026ldquo;worker\u0026rdquo; - one with a \u0026ldquo;running\u0026rdquo; session.\nThis is why we cannot simply run more containers using Kubernetes Deployment/AWS ECS (though you can use StatefulSets for k8s). We need to care about WHERE we run the session and WHERE we send the request.\nAnd a few more reasons:\nSimple - you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about the load balancer, k8s, docker, etc. Independent - you can run WAHA instances on different servers, different cloud providers, bare-metal, etc. No single point of failure - if one WAHA instance goes down - the others are still working. Flexible - you can configure HOW you distribute sessions across different servers based on your business logic. Frees our hands - we can focus on building the best WhatsApp API and adding new features, and you can focus on building the best application. 😊 Single Dashboard - Multiple Servers If you\u0026rsquo;re running multiple servers, you can run a dedicated WAHA 📊 Dashboard just to have a single place from which you can manage all servers:\nClick to open full size. After that, you can connect all servers to the single dashboard:\nClick to open full size. Horizontal Scaling - Auto-Scaling 🚧🔨⏳ Auto-Scaling IS NOT AVAILABLE out-of-the-box in WAHA yet! ⏳🔨🚧\nWe\u0026rsquo;re working on it, but it\u0026rsquo;s not ready yet, so we\u0026rsquo;re just giving you a future vision of how it will work.\nThe idea is to build WAHA Hub that will handle all API requests and distribute them to the WAHA Workers based on information about where each session is running.\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll also control (using underlying k8s or docker infrastructure) the number of workers based on the load.\nClick to open full size. Kindly support the project on the PRO tier if you wish to use this feature in the future! 🙏\nFor now, Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling - Sharding are the ways to go.\n","date":"2024-08-14","id":99,"permalink":"/blog/waha-scaling-how-to-handle-500-sessions/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"overview\"\u003eOverview\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article is for people who want to scale their WhatsApp API for customers, like CRM, SaaS, or other services and\nwho need to handle a lot (\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026gt;100\u003c/strong\u003e) of \u003ca href=\"/docs/how-to/sessions/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e🖥️ Sessions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (WhatsApp Accounts).\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"WAHA Scaling - How To Handle 500+ Sessions"},{"content":"🎉 We are thrilled to announce the release of WAHA 2024.8 🎉\nWhatsApp Business Labels API You can now work with WhatsApp Labels available in WhatsApp Business using the API!\nLabels API Here\u0026rsquo;s Get labels API example:\nGET /api/{session}/labels\rResponse:\n[ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New Client\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;color\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;colorHex\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#64c4ff\u0026#34; }, ... ]\r👉 Read more about the WhatsApp Business Labels API on 🏷️ Labels page!\nLabels Events You can now receive information about label creation, update, and deletion using webhooks!\nlabel.upsert\r{ \u0026#34;event\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;label.upsert\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;session\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;payload\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Label Name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;color\u0026#34;: 14, \u0026#34;colorHex\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#00a0f2\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;engine\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NOWEB\u0026#34;, ... }\r👉 Read more about the Labels Events on 🏷️ Labels page!\nChat archive/unarchive You can now archive and unarchive WhatsApp Chats using API and receive events about chat archive in WhatsApp using webhooks!\nChat archive API Use the method to archive chat\nPOST /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/archive\rUse the method to unarchive chat\nPOST /api/{session}/chats/{chatId}/unarchive\r👉 Read more about the endpoints on 💬 Chats page!\nChat archive Events Enable chat.archive event when starting a new session and receive information about chat archive in WhatsApp using events:\nchat.archive\r{ \u0026#34;event\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;chat.archive\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;session\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;payload\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;123123123@c.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: 1667561485, \u0026#34;archived\u0026#34;: true \u0026lt;== or false }, ... }\r👉 Read more about the events on 🔄 Webhooks page!\nCalls Events Now when the WhatsApp account receives (rejects and accepts) a new call - you can receive information about that using new call.* webhooks!\nEnable call.* events when starting a new session and receive information about calls in WhatsApp using events:\ncall.received\r{ \u0026#34;event\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;call.received\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;session\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;payload\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;from\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;22222222222@c.us\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: 1721374000, \u0026#34;isVideo\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;isGroup\u0026#34;: false }, ... }\r👉 Read more about the events on 📞 Calls page!\nAnd more! 👉 Read the full 🆕 Changelog for WAHA 2024.8 release!\n","date":"2024-08-01","id":100,"permalink":"/blog/waha-2024.8-whatsapp-business-labels-api-chat-archive-and-more/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e🎉 We are thrilled to announce the release of \u003ca href=\"/docs/overview/changelog/#20248\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWAHA 2024.8\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e 🎉\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whatsapp-business-labels-api\"\u003eWhatsApp Business Labels API\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can now work with \u003cstrong\u003eWhatsApp Labels\u003c/strong\u003e available in WhatsApp Business using the API!\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"WAHA 2024.8 - WhatsApp Business Labels API, Chat Archive and more!"},{"content":"🎉 We are thrilled to announce the release of WAHA 2024.7 🎉\nWhatsApp Channels API WAHA now supports WhatsApp Channels - a brand-new feature introduced by WhatsApp. You can manage, read and send messages to WhatsApp Channels (aka Newsletters) via API.\n👉 Read more about available features on 📢 Channels documentation page.\n💡 If you\u0026rsquo;re completely new with the project, we wrote a Step-By-Step Guide on How to send a post to WhatsApp Channel via API\nJSON logs WAHA now supports JSON logs.

Even if you have set up WAHA and protected it with an API key and username/password (as we recommend on 🔒 Security) - it\u0026rsquo;s still not enough, because of Man-in-the-middle attacks. If you\u0026rsquo;re exposing WAHA to the internet, you should always use HTTPS to protect your data from being intercepted.\nUse Nginx to handle HTTPS\nWe recommend handling HTTPS termination with a reverse proxy like Nginx.\nFollow one of available multiple deployment methods to set up WAHA HTTPS.\nYou can set up the following environment variables to enable HTTPS:\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt - use Certbot to get a free certificate from Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt. Self-signed certificate - generate a self-signed certificate and use it for HTTPS. Using reverse proxy - use Nginx as a reverse proxy and set up HTTPS there. Using Ngrok - expose your WAHA safely on internet, even without Public IP or DNS name. Configuration WAHA supports HTTPS out of the box if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use a reverse proxy like Nginx.\nYou can set up the following environment variables to enable HTTPS:\nWAHA_HTTPS_ENABLED=true: Set this variable to true to enable HTTPS. By default, it\u0026rsquo;s false. WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_KEY=/path/to/key.pem: The path to the key file for HTTPS. By default ./.secrets/privkey.pem WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem: The path to the certificate file for HTTPS. By default ./.secrets/cert.pem WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_CA=/path/to/ca.pem: The path to the CA file for HTTPS. By default ./.secrets/chain.pem Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt (Certbot) + WAHA Certbot is a free and open-source tool that can be used to get a free certificate from Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt.\nWAHA can use the certificate generated by Certbot to enable HTTPS.\nStep 0: Requirements Here\u0026rsquo;s assumptions for this guide:\nDedicated server or VPS with Public IP ( like DigitalOcean DropLet) Ubuntu 22.04 - clean installation Public IP assigned to the server (like 109.71.242.111) Domain pointed to the Public IP (like waha.example.pro) You can get the updated Certbot documentation, and Step 7: Install your certificate - this is where we need to configure WAHA to use the certificates.\nStep 1: Install Certbot sudo snap install --classic certbot sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot\rStep 2: Issuing certificate Choose how you\u0026rsquo;d like to run Certbot - Are you ok with temporarily stopping your website?\nYes, my web server is not currently running on this machine. Stop your webserver, then run this command to get a certificate. Certbot will temporarily spin up a webserver on your machine.\nsudo systemctl stop nginx sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d waha.example.com # \u0026lt;=== change to your domain\rNo, I need to keep my web server running. sudo certbot certonly --webroot # sudo certbot certonly --webroot /var/www/html\rStep 3: Run WAHA After you get the certificates, you can run it\n👇 Few notes:\nChange waha.example.pro to your domain We\u0026rsquo;re running it with -it flag to see the logs, in production you need to run it with docker run -d instead. We map the whole /etc/letsencrypt folder because of the way how letsencrypt works with \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; keys (it\u0026rsquo;s symlinks to \u0026ldquo;archive\u0026rdquo; directory files) DOMAIN=waha.example.pro # Change it to your domain! docker run -it \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ -v $(pwd)/.sessions:/app/.sessions \\ -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \\ --env WAHA_HTTPS_ENABLED=true \\ --env WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_KEY=/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/privkey.pem \\ --env WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_CERT=/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/cert.pem \\ --env WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_CA=/etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/chain.pem \\ --env WHATSAPP_API_SCHEMA=https, --env WHATSAPP_API_PORT=3000, --env WHATSAPP_API_HOSTNAME=$DOMAIN \\ --restart always \\ devlikeapro/waha-plus\rNow open https://waha.example.com:3000 and check the HTTPS connection.\nIf it works - consider using docker-compose file for running the project, it can be hard to write such long command or using sh scripts for that.\nStep 4: Test auto renewal When Certbot renew the certificate - WAHA automatically updates HTTPS server and use new certificate with no restart.\nsudo certbot renew --dry-run\rSelf-signed certificate + WAHA As an alternative, you can issue self-signed certificate (for instance, to test the connection on localhost).\nIt\u0026rsquo;ll show you an error on browser, so you need to accept it before accessing the site, but it won\u0026rsquo;t show expose the API key during network communication even in public networks. Step 1: Generate certificates mkdir .secrets openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out .secrets/privkey.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 openssl req -new -key .secrets/privkey.pem -out .secrets/cert.csr -subj \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -key .secrets/privkey.pem -in .secrets/cert.csr -out .secrets/cert.pem cp .secrets/cert.pem .secrets/chain.pem echo \u0026#34;DONE!\u0026#34;\rStep 2: Run WAHA 👇 Few notes:\nWe\u0026rsquo;re running it with -it flag to see the logs, in production you need to run it with docker run -d instead. docker run -it \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ -v $(pwd)/.sessions:/app/.sessions \\ -v $(pwd)/.secrets:/app/.secrets \\ -e WAHA_HTTPS_ENABLED=true \\ -e WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_KEY=.secrets/privkey.pem \\ -e WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_CERT=.secrets/cert.pem \\ -e WAHA_HTTPS_PATH_CA=.secrets/chain.pem \\ devlikeapro/waha-plus\rOpen https://localhost:3000 and accept self-signed certificate in your browser.\nIf it works - consider using docker-compose file for running the project, it can be hard to write such long command or using sh scripts for that.\nUsing External Reverse Proxy The best way to set up HTTPS is to use a reverse proxy like Nginx. The idea is WAHA exposes the HTTP port and Nginx handles the HTTPS part and forwards the requests to WAHA. It distributes the load and make it easier to manage the HTTPS part.\nUnfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more complicated than the previous options, so we don\u0026rsquo;t cover it in the guide.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some articles that can help you set up HTTPS with Nginx and docker-compose:\nCertbot + Nginx + Docker Using Ngrok WAHA + Ngrok - Running WAHA on local network You also can set up WAHA to use Ngrok so it handles HTTPS for you, even if you\u0026rsquo;re running it NOT on local server!\n","date":"2024-06-17","id":115,"permalink":"/blog/setting-up-https-for-waha/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"why-bother-with-https\"\u003eWhy bother with HTTPS?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if you have set up WAHA and protected it with an API key and username/password\n(as we recommend on \u003ca href=\"/docs/how-to/security/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e🔒 Security\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) - it\u0026rsquo;s still not enough, because of\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\"\u003eMan-in-the-middle attacks\u003c/a\u003e.\n\r\n\r\n\u003cimg\r\n  src=\"/blog/setting-up-https-for-waha/mitm_hu_9a6e96aced174fef.webp\"\r\n  width=\"768\"\r\n  height=\"403\"\r\n  decoding=\"async\"\r\n  fetchpriority=\"auto\"\r\n  loading=\"lazy\"\r\n  alt=\"alt\"id=\"h-rh-i-0\"\r\n/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Setting up HTTPS for WAHA"},{"content":"WAHA + Geonode Proxy If you see the below error, you can use the Geonode proxies to solve this issue.\nRead more about Proxies.\nCould not log in.

Proxy is not super stable, so you can disable it and enable it again if you see issues. Proxy is not free, so you can disable it when you don\u0026rsquo;t need it.
